Criminals are exploiting hardware and software vulnerabilities to interact with ATMs, meaning they need to be made more secure. This can be achieved with the help of additional security software, properly configured to stop the execution of non-allowlisted programs on ATMs.\nWorryingly, it is very easy to find detailed manuals of ATM malware. Anybody can simply buy them for around 5000 USD on darknet markets.\nMore information about CutletMaker ATM malware is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Service. Contact:\nintelreports@kaspersky.com\nIntroduction\nIn May 2017, Kaspersky Lab researchers discovered a forum post advertising ATM malware that was targeting specific vendor ATMs. The forum contained a short description of a crimeware kit designed to empty ATMs with the help of a vendor specific API, without interacting with ATM users and their data. The post links to an offer that was initially published on the\nAlphaBay\nDarknet marketplace, which was recently\ntaken down\nby the FBI.\nAdvertisement post\nAn offer post on AlphaBay market\nThe price of the kit was 5000 USD at the time of research. The AlphaBay description includes details such as the required equipment, targeted ATMs models, as well as tips and tricks for the malware’s operation. And part of a detailed manual for the toolkit was also provided.\nScreenshot of a description on AlphaBay market\nPreviously described ATM malware\nTyupkin\nwas also mentioned in this text. The manual “\nWall ATM Read Me.txt\n” was distributed as a plain text file, written in poor English and with bad text formatting. The use of slang and grammatical mistakes suggests that this text was most likely written by a native Russian-speaker.\nApart of a manual with text formatting applied\nThe manual provides a detailed picture, though only a fragment of the complete manual is being shown. There is a description for each step of the dispense process:\nPrepare an all tools, all the programs should be placed on a flash disk.\nTools are wireless keyboard, usb hub, usb cable, usb adapter usb a female to b female, Windows 7 laptop or a tablet ( to run code generator) and a drill.\nFind an appropriate ATM\nOpen ATM door and plug into USB port.\nExecute Stimulator to see full information of all the ATM cassettes.\nExecute CUTLET MAKER to get it is code.\nExecute password generator on a tablet or on a laptop and paste CUTLET MAKER code to it, put the result password to CUTLET MAKER.\nDispense the money from chosen cassette.\nThe manual provides usage descriptions for all parts of the toolset. The list of crimeware from the kit consists of\nCUTLET MAKER\nATM malware, the primary element, with a password generator included and a\nStimulator\n– an application to gather cash cassette statuses of a target ATM. The crimeware kit is a collection of programs possibly written by different authors, though\nCUTLET MAKER\nand\nStimulator\nwere protected in the same way,\nc0decalc\nis a simple terminal-based application without any protection at all.\nDelicious cutlet ingredients: CUTLET MAKER, c0decalc and Stimulator\nThe first sample was named “CUTLET MAKER” by its authors and has been designed to operate the cash dispense process on specific vendor ATMs.\nTo answer the question of how a cook from the CUTLET MAKER interface and cutlets relate to stealing money from ATMs, we must explain the meaning of the word “\nCutlet\n“. Originally, it means a meat dish, but as a Russian slang term “\nCutlet\n” (котлета) means “a bundle of money”, suggesting that the criminals behind the malware might be native Russian speakers.\nThe “Cutlet Maker” malware functionality suggests that two people are supposed to be involved in the theft – the roles are called “drop” and “drop master”. Access to the dispense mechanism of CUTLET MAKER is password protected. Though there could be just one person with the\nc0decalc\napplication needed to generate a password. Either network or physical access to an ATM is required to enter the code in the application text area and also to interact with the user interface.\nStimulator was possibly developed by the same authors. Its purpose is to retrieve and show the status information of specific vendor ATM cash cassettes (such as currency, value and the amount of notes).\nCUTLET MAKER and c0decalc\nCUTLET MAKER is the main module responsible for dispensing money from the ATM. The sample analysed in this research has the MD5 checksum “fac356509a156a8f11ce69f149198108” and the compilation timestamp Sat Jul 30 20:17:08 2016 UTC.\nThe program is written in Delphi and was packed with VMProtect, however it is possible that multiple packers might have been used.\nDifferent versions of the main component were found while researching this toolset. The first known submission of the first version sent to a public multiscanner service took place on June 22nd 2016. All submissions discovered by Kaspersky Lab were performed from different countries, with Ukraine being the chronological first country of origin.\nKnown CUTLET MAKER filenames (according to public multiscanner service information):\ncm.vmp.exe\ncm15.vmp.exe\ncm16F.exe\ncm17F.exe\nThe following version information was captured from the application’s window caption, followed after a “\nCUTLET MAKER\n” name. Known versions at the time of research were:\n1.0\n1.02\n1.0 F\nThe assumed development period is from 2016-06-22 to 2016-08-18, according to the first submission date of the earliest version and the last submission date of the latest version at the time of writing. The application requires a special library to operate, which is part of a proprietary ATM API, controlling the cash dispenser unit.\nWith all the dependencies in place, the interface shows a code.\nCUTLET MAKER challenge code marked with red rectangle\nIn order to unlock the application, a password from\nc0decalc\ngenerator needs to be entered, thereby answering the given challenge code. If the password is incorrect, the interface won’t react to any further input.\nEach “\nCHECK HEAT\n” and “\nstart cooking!\n” button corresponds to a specific ATM cash cassette. Buttons labeled “\nCHECK HEAT”\ndispense one note, “\nstart cooking!”\ndispenses 50 “cutlets” with 60 notes each.  The “\nStop!\n” button stops an ongoing “\nstart cooking!\n” process. “\nReset”\nis intended to reset the dispense process.\nc0decalc a password generator for CUTLET MAKER\nThis tool is an unprotected command line application, written in Visual C. The purpose of this application is to generate a password for CUTLET MAKER’s graphical interface.\nThe compilation timestamp for this specific sample is Sun Nov 13 11:35:25 2016 UTC and was first uploaded to a public multiscanner service on December 7th 2016.\nExample output for “12345678” input\nKaspersky Lab researchers checked the algorithm during the analysis and found “\nCUTLET MAKER\n” working with the passwords generated by “c0decalc”.\nStimulator\nThe\nStimulator\nsample analysed in this research has the MD5 hash\n“27640bb7908ca7303d13d50c14ccf669”\n. This sample is also written in Delphi and packed the same way as “CUTLET MAKER”. The compilation timestamp is Sat Jul 16 18:34:47 2016 UTC.\nThe application is designed to work on specific vendor ATMs and also uses proprietary API calls.\nSome additional symbols were found in the memory dump of a “Stimulator” process, pointing to an interesting part of the application. After execution and pressing the “STIMULATE ME!” button, the proprietary API function is used to fetch an ATM’s cassette status. The following cassette state results are used:\n1CUR\n2CUR\n3CUR\n4CUR\n1VAL\n2VAL\n3VAL\n4VAL\n1NDV\n2NDV\n3NDV\n4NDV\n1ACT\n2ACT\n3ACT\n4ACT\nEach preceding number is mapped to an ATM cassette. The three character states are interpreted as follows:\nn\nCUR\ncassette\nn\ncurrency (like “USD”, “RUB”)\nn\nVAL\ncassette\nn\nnote value (like 00000005, 00000020 )\nn\nACT\ncassette\nn\ncounter for specific notes in a cassette (value from 0 to 3000)\nn\nNDV\nnumber of notes in the ATM for cassette\nn\n(value from 0 to 3000)\nThe result of “STIMULATE ME!” button press in proper environment\nEach column, shown in the picture above\n,\ndescribes the state of one corresponding ATM cassette.\nThe background picture used in the application interface turns out to be quite unique, the original photo was posted on a DIY blog:\nhttps://www.oldtownhome.com/2011/8/4/Knock-Knock-Whos-There-Merv-the-Perv/\nOriginal picture as used in “Stimulator” application (photo by Alex Santantonio)\nConclusion\nThis type of malware does not affect bank customers directly, it is intended for the theft of cash from specific vendor ATMs. CUTLET MAKER and Stimulator show how criminals are using legitimate proprietary libraries and a small piece of code to dispense money from an ATM. Examples of appropriate countermeasures against such attacks include default-deny policies and device control. The first measure prevents criminals from running their own code on the ATM’s internal PC. It is likely that ATMs in these attacks were infected through physical access to the PC, which means criminals were using USB drives to install malware onto the machine. In such a case, device control software would prevent them from connecting new devices, such as USB sticks.\nKaspersky Embedded Systems Security\nwill help to extend the security level of ATMs.\nKaspersky Lab products detects this threats as Backdoor.Win32.ATMletcut, Backdoor.Win32.ATMulator, Trojan.Win32.Agent.ikmo\nATM\nDarknet\nFinancial malware\nMalware Descriptions\nAuthors\nKonstantin Zykov\nATM malware is being sold on Darknet market\nYour email address will not be published.\nRequired fields are marked\n*\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nCancel\nΔ\nshahab\nPosted on\nOctober 30, 2017. 8:56 pm\nwell cutlet(کتلت) is an Iranian food..so I guess the author was not actually Russian….and you se the app saying lets cook some culet with that picture that somehow looks like a cutlet… anyway I say that’s an Iranian.\nReply\nTable of Contents\nDisclaimer and warning\nIntroduction\nDelicious cutlet ingredients: CUTLET MAKER, c0decalc and Stimulator\nCUTLET MAKER and c0decalc\nc0decalc a password generator for CUTLET MAKER\nStimulator\nConclusion\nGReAT webinars\n13 May 2021, 1:00pm\nGReAT Ideas.

For other uses, see\nDarknet (disambiguation)\n. For websites that exist on top of this technology, see\ndark web\n.\nSurface web in relation to Deep web and Dark web\nA\ndarknet\nor\ndark net\nis an\noverlay network\nwithin the\nInternet\nthat can only be accessed with specific software, configurations, or authorization,\n[\n1\n]\nand often uses a unique customized\ncommunication protocol\n. Two typical darknet types are social networks\n[\n2\n]\n(usually used for\nfile hosting\nwith a\npeer-to-peer\nconnection),\n[\n3\n]\nand\nanonymity\nproxy networks\nsuch as\nTor\nvia an anonymized series of connections.\n[\n4\n]\nThe term \"darknet\" was popularized by major news outlets and was associated with\nTor Onion services\nwhen the infamous drug bazaar\nSilk Road\nused it,\n[\n5\n]\ndespite the terminology being unofficial. Technology such as\nTor\n,\nI2P\n, and\nFreenet\nare intended to defend digital rights by providing security, anonymity, or censorship resistance and are used for both illegal and legitimate reasons. Anonymous communication between\nwhistle-blowers\n, activists, journalists and news organisations is also facilitated by darknets through use of applications such as\nSecureDrop\n.\n[\n6\n]\nTerminology\nThe term originally described computers on\nARPANET\nthat were hidden, programmed to receive messages but not respond to or acknowledge anything, thus remaining invisible and in the dark.\n[\n7\n]\nSince\nARPANET\n, the usage of dark net has expanded to include\nfriend-to-friend\nnetworks (usually used for\nfile sharing\nwith a\npeer-to-peer\nconnection) and\nprivacy\nnetworks such as Tor.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nThe reciprocal term for a darknet is a\nclearnet\nor the\nsurface web\nwhen referring to content indexable by search engines.\n[\n10\n]\nThe term \"darknet\" is often used\ninterchangeably\nwith \"\ndark web\n\" because of the quantity of\nhidden services\non\nTor\n's darknet. Additionally, the term is often inaccurately used interchangeably with the\ndeep web\nbecause of Tor's history as a platform that could not be search-indexed. Mixing uses of both these terms has been described as inaccurate, with some commentators recommending the terms be used in distinct fashions.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nOrigins\n\"Darknet\" was coined in the 1970s to designate networks isolated from\nARPANET\n(the government-founded military/academical network which evolved into the\nInternet\n), for security purposes.\n[\n7\n]\nDarknet addresses could receive data from ARPANET but did not appear in the network lists and would not answer\npings\nor other inquiries.\nThe term gained public acceptance following publication of \"The Darknet and the Future of\nContent Distribution\n\", a 2002 paper by\nPeter Biddle\n, Paul England, Marcus Peinado, and Bryan Willman, four employees of\nMicrosoft\nwho argued the presence of the darknet was the primary hindrance to the development of workable\ndigital rights management\n(DRM) technologies and made\ncopyright infringement\ninevitable.\n[\n14\n]\nThis paper described \"darknet\" more generally as any type of parallel network that is encrypted or requires a specific protocol to allow a user to connect to it.\n[\n1\n]\nSub-cultures\nJournalist\nJ. D. Lasica\n, in his 2005 book\nDarknet: Hollywood's War Against the Digital Generation\n, described the darknet's reach encompassing file sharing networks.\n[\n15\n]\nSubsequently, in 2014, journalist\nJamie Bartlett\nin his book\nThe Dark Net\nused the term to describe a range of underground and emergent\nsubcultures\n, including\ncamgirls\n,\ncryptoanarchists\n,\ndarknet drug markets\n,\nself harm\ncommunities,\nsocial media\nracists, and\ntranshumanists\n.\n[\n16\n]\nUses\nDarknets in general may be used for various reasons, such as:\nTo better protect the\nprivacy\nrights of citizens from\ntargeted\nand\nmass\nsurveillance\nComputer crime\n(cracking, file corruption, etc.)\nProtecting\ndissidents\nfrom political reprisal\nFile sharing\n(\nwarez\n, personal files, pornography, confidential files, illegal or counterfeit software, etc.)\nSale of restricted goods on\ndarknet markets\nWhistleblowing\nand\nnews leaks\nPurchase or sale of illicit or illegal goods or services\n[\n17\n]\nCircumventing\nnetwork censorship\nand\ncontent-filtering systems\n, or bypassing restrictive\nfirewall\npolicies\n[\n18\n]\nSoftware\nAll darknets require specific software installed or network configurations made to access them, such as\nTor\n, which can be accessed via a customized browser from\nVidalia\n(aka the Tor browser bundle), or alternatively via a\nproxy\nconfigured to perform the same function.\nActive\nTor is the most popular instance of a darknet,\n[\n19\n]\nand it is often mistakenly thought to be the only online tool that facilitates access to darknets.\nA\ncartogram\nillustrating the average number of Tor users per day between August 2012 and July 2013\nAlphabetical list:\nanoNet\nis a decentralized friend-to-friend network built using\nVPN\nand software\nBGP\nrouters.\nDecentralized network 42\n(not for anonymity but research purposes).\nFreenet\nis a popular\nDHT\nfile hosting darknet platform.

BreachForums\nBreachForums gained prominence after RaidForums shut down.\nPompompurin\nlaunched Breached, which quickly became a hub for cybercriminals. However, Pompompurin was arrested on March 15, 2023, leading to BreachForums’ temporary closure. It re-emerged on June 12, 2023, under\nShinyHunters\n, a notorious threat group.\nBreachForums is notable for its vast database, with over 15 billion records from 936 datasets. It features sections like Leaks and\nStealer Logs\nand has a unique ranking system. The escrow system secures transactions, attracting high-profile threat actors.\n2. XSS\nXSS, established in 2013 and rebranded in 2018, is a key forum in the Russian-speaking cyber landscape. Accessible via both TOR and the surface web, it deals with unauthorized access sales, malware exchanges, and database trading.\nXSS hosts prominent Russian threat actors like\nLockBit\nand REvil. It serves as a recruitment and promotion hub for\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\ngroups. Its longevity and operational security practices contribute to its popularity and secrecy.\n3. LeakBase\nLeakBase, launched in January 2023, quickly filled the void left by BreachForums. This English-speaking forum, accessible on the surface web, gained nearly 50,000 members swiftly. It discusses data leaks, vulnerabilities, malware, and legal tools, attracting prominent threat actors.\nIts stance against sharing data about Russia indicates a nuanced approach to geopolitical sensitivities. LeakBase’s vibrant community and administrative team fuel its prominence in the cybercrime landscape.\nMore on Ransomware groups\nBianLian Ransomware Group: A Rising Threat in Cybercrime\nThe Black Basta Cyber Threat\nRhysida Ransomware Group\nThe Akira Ransomware Gang\nCl0p Ransomware Gang: The Unseen Cyber Menace\nAlphv: A New Era of Cyber Threats\nLockbit Breakdown: Cyber operations, evolution, and impacts\n4. Exploit.in\nFounded in 2005,\nExploit is a leading Russian hacker forum\noperating on both TOR and the surface web. It connects cybercriminals with collaborators for\nhacking\n, fraud, and RaaS activities. Its structured organization and membership policies project professionalism, attracting genuine content and marginalizing non-Russian speakers.\n5. Altenen\nAltenen, an English-speaking forum focused on\ncredit card fraud\n, has been active since 2008. Despite its founder’s arrest in 2018, it continues to thrive. Altenen requires new members to share its domains on social media platforms, ensuring ongoing activity.\n6. Nulled\nEstablished in 2015, Nulled is a notorious English-language cybercriminal forum on the dark web. It hosts leaked data, compromised identities, and illegal tools. Despite a major data breach in 2016, it remains relevant due to its broad focus on illicit content.\n7. RAMP\nLaunched in July 2021, RAMP (Russian Anonymous Market Place) stands out for its multilingual user base and stringent membership policies. It capitalized on the\nColonial Pipeline attack\naftermath, serving\nRaaS groups\nand distinguishing itself with a partners program for recruiting hackers and selling initial access.\n8. Cracked\nCracked operates on the surface web, discussing combo lists, vulnerabilities, and hacking tools. It features 12 subforums for different languages, with the French subforum being the most active.\n9. CraxPro\nEstablished in 2020, CraxPro discusses passport/ID sales, credentials, proxies, and credit card fraud. Despite inaccuracies in credit card information, it remains active due to its comprehensive discussions on various illicit activities.\n10. Dread\nFounded in 2018 by\nHugBunter\n, Dread is likened to the “Reddit of the dark web” due to its interface. While it mainly focuses on drug sales, hacking-related topics are increasing, making it a significant forum despite its lower ranking.\nWhy Cybercriminals Use Dark Web Forums\nWhy Cybercriminals Use Dark Web Forums\nCybercriminals use dark web forums for several reasons. These hidden platforms provide the ideal environment for illegal activities, ensuring anonymity, security, and access to a global network of like-minded individuals. Let’s explore the key reasons why cybercriminals flock to these forums.\nAnonymity\nAnonymity is the primary attraction of dark web forums. Cybercriminals can hide their identities and activities from law enforcement and other entities. Tools like Tor and I2P provide secure, encrypted access to these forums, masking users’ IP addresses and making it difficult to trace their activities.\nPseudonymous Identities\nMost forum users operate under pseudonyms, further protecting their real identities. This anonymity encourages open communication and the sharing of sensitive information without fear of exposure.\nEncrypted Communication\nDark web forums use advanced encryption techniques to secure communications between users. This ensures that messages, transactions, and data exchanges remain confidential and protected from interception.\nEscrow Services\nMany forums offer escrow services to facilitate safe transactions. These services act as intermediaries, holding funds until both parties fulfill their obligations. This reduces the risk of scams and builds trust among users.\nStolen Data\nForums provide a marketplace for buying and selling stolen data, including credit card information, personal identities, and login credentials. This data fuels various cybercriminal activities like identity theft and fraud.\nHacking Tools\nCybercriminals can purchase or exchange hacking tools, malware, and exploits. These tools enable them to conduct attacks on individuals, businesses, and institutions.\nLearn about the Cyber Attack Cycle\nCyber Attack Cycle: Actions Phase\nCyber Attack Cycle: Command & Control (C2)\nCyber Attack Cycle: Installation Phase\nCyber Attack Cycle: Exploitation Phase\nCyber Attack Cycle: Weaponization and Delivery\nCyber Attack Cycle:  Reconnaissance Attacks\nIllicit Services\nDark web forums offer a range of illicit services, from hacking and DDoS attacks to money laundering and counterfeit document creation. These services help criminals execute complex schemes and evade detection.\nCommunity Support\nForums create a sense of community among cybercriminals. Users can share knowledge, seek advice, and collaborate on projects. This communal support fosters the development of new skills and techniques.\nRecruitment\nMany forums serve as recruitment grounds for cybercriminal groups. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) groups, for instance, use these platforms to find affiliates and partners. This collaboration expands the reach and impact of their operations.\nCryptocurrency Use\nTransactions on dark web forums typically use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Monero. These digital currencies offer anonymity and are difficult to trace, making them ideal for illegal transactions.\nEscrow and Feedback Systems\nTo enhance trust, many forums implement escrow services and feedback systems. Escrow services ensure secure transactions, while feedback systems allow users to rate and review sellers, promoting reliability.\nDark web forums user\nConstant Adaptation\nDark web forums are constantly evolving to evade law enforcement. When one forum is shut down, others quickly rise to take its place. This adaptability makes it challenging for authorities to dismantle these networks completely.\nJurisdictional Challenges\nThe global nature of the dark web complicates law enforcement efforts. Cybercriminals operate across borders, exploiting differences in legal jurisdictions to avoid prosecution.\nSafe Havens\nCertain regions and countries offer more lenient regulations or limited law enforcement capabilities, providing safe havens for cybercriminals. Forums often have policies that reflect these geopolitical realities, such as not sharing data about certain nations.\nPolitical Motives\nSome cybercriminals are motivated by political agendas. Forums can serve as platforms for these individuals to coordinate activities, share information, and launch politically motivated attacks.\nTutorials and Guides\nForums often feature tutorials, guides, and resources for learning new hacking techniques and improving existing skills. This educational aspect attracts aspiring cybercriminals looking to hone their craft.\nSharing of Vulnerabilities\nUsers share information about vulnerabilities and exploits, enabling others to capitalize on these weaknesses before they are patched. This continuous exchange of information drives the rapid evolution of\ncyber threats\n.\nCertiscope – Simplifying SSL/TLS Certificate Monitoring\nHide anything in everything\nHack and Leak Crime\nSupply Chain Attacks: Why Your Vendors Could Be Your Biggest Risk\nCybersecurity Board Communication: How to Engage with Impact\nConclusion\nDark web forums provide a conducive environment for cybercriminals, offering anonymity, security, and access to a global network. These platforms facilitate the exchange of illicit goods and services, foster collaboration, and help criminals evade law enforcement.\nUnderstanding the reasons behind their popularity can help cybersecurity engineers to develop more effective strategies to combat these digital threats.\nWritten by\nReza Rafati\nReza Rafati is an experienced cyber security professional.

We have seen scenarios where software vulnerabilities have been disclosed by vendors and shortly after, operational exploits are available on darknet forums and marketplaces. Many marketplace vendors offer zero-day exploits that have not yet been discovered or disclosed. This trend has led to security companies offering darknet analysis services to detect new exploits and malware, providing proactive threat intelligence. This paper presents information on the scale of malware distribution, the trends of malware types offered, the methods for discovering new exploits and the effectiveness of darknet analysis in detecting malware at the earliest possible stage.\nComments:\n5 pages, 0 figures\nSubjects:\nCryptography and Security (cs.CR)\nCite as:\narXiv:2211.15405\n[cs.CR]\n(or\narXiv:2211.15405v1\n[cs.CR]\nfor this version)\nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.15405\nFocus to learn more\narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\nSubmission history\nFrom: Jonah Burgess [\nview email\n]\n[v1]\nFri, 30 Sep 2022 12:44:44 UTC (267 KB)\nFull-text links:\nAccess Paper:\nView a PDF of the paper titled Malware and Exploits on the Dark Web, by Jonah Burgess\nView PDF\nOther Formats\nview license\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CR\n< prev\n|\nnext >\nnew\n|\nrecent\n|\n2022-11\nChange to browse by:\ncs\nReferences & Citations\nNASA ADS\nGoogle Scholar\nSemantic Scholar\na\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibTeX formatted citation\n×\nloading...\nData provided by:\nBookmark\nBibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer\n(\nWhat is the Explorer?\n)\nConnected Papers Toggle\nConnected Papers\n(\nWhat is Connected Papers?\n)\nLitmaps Toggle\nLitmaps\n(\nWhat is Litmaps?\n)\nscite.ai Toggle\nscite Smart Citations\n(\nWhat are Smart Citations?\n)\nCode, Data, Media\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv Toggle\nalphaXiv\n(\nWhat is alphaXiv?\n)\nLinks to Code Toggle\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n(\nWhat is CatalyzeX?\n)\nDagsHub Toggle\nDagsHub\n(\nWhat is DagsHub?\n)\nGotitPub Toggle\nGotit.pub\n(\nWhat is GotitPub?\n)\nHuggingface Toggle\nHugging Face\n(\nWhat is Huggingface?\n)\nLinks to Code Toggle\nPapers with Code\n(\nWhat is Papers with Code?\n)\nScienceCast Toggle\nScienceCast\n(\nWhat is ScienceCast?\n)\nDemos\nDemos\nReplicate Toggle\nReplicate\n(\nWhat is Replicate?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nHugging Face Spaces\n(\nWhat is Spaces?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nTXYZ.AI\n(\nWhat is TXYZ.AI?\n)\nRelated Papers\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nLink to Influence Flower\nInfluence Flower\n(\nWhat are Influence Flowers?\n)\nCore recommender toggle\nCORE Recommender\n(\nWhat is CORE?\n)\nAuthor\nVenue\nInstitution\nTopic\nAbout arXivLabs\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?\nLearn more about arXivLabs\n.\nWhich authors of this paper are endorsers?\n|\nDisable MathJax\n(\nWhat is MathJax?\n)\nAbout\nHelp\ncontact arXiv\nClick here to contact arXiv\nContact\nsubscribe to arXiv mailings\nClick here to subscribe\nSubscribe\nCopyright\nPrivacy Policy\nWeb Accessibility Assistance\narXiv Operational Status\nGet status notifications via\nemail\nor\nslack"

These forums are not just meeting places for hackers and threat actors; they are vibrant ecosystems where stolen data, hacking tools, and illicit services exchange hands in the shadows. From the depths of this hidden internet, we’ve distilled a list of the top ten dark web forums, each distinguished by its unique contribution to the cybercrime landscape.\nOur exploration takes us through the digital alleyways of the internet’s underbelly, where forums like\nBreachForums\nand\nXSS\noffer a glimpse into the sophisticated world of cyber threats and data breaches. These platforms shrouded in anonymity, are where the boundaries of legality blur, challenging cybersecurity efforts worldwide. As we unveil these forums, we aim to provide insights into their operations, memberships, and the overarching impact they have on both the cyber and physical realms.\nAn overview of the cybercrime forums\n1 – BreachForums\nBreachForums quickly emerged as a hot topic among mainstream media discussions about dark web forums, especially after\nRaidForums\nwas closed and BreachForums took its place. The story began when a known threat actor,\nPompompurin\n, launched Breached after RaidForums’ demise.\nThis development resulted in Pompompurin’s arrest by US law enforcement on March 15, 2023, and the subsequent closure of Breached (also known as BreachForums) didn’t mark the end. Instead, a new team revived the forum under the BreachForums banner, swiftly becoming the dark web’s focal point and succeeding where previous forums had been silenced.\nBreachForums’ home screen\nOn June 12, 2023, BreachForums returned under the banner of\nShinyHunters\n, one of the most active threat groups. Despite initial skepticism over its legitimacy, with some fearing it was an FBI trap, a PGP-signed message from a former administrator,\nBaphomet\n, confirmed its return. ShinyHunters, notorious for significant alleged data breaches targeting companies like\nTokopedia\nand\nMicrosoft’s GitHub\n, has continued to draw attention for selling stolen data, underscoring ongoing cybersecurity and data protection challenges.\nBreachForums stands out for its administrator-approved database category, boasting over\n15 billion\nrecords from\n936 datasets\n. The forum’s active sections, including Leaks, Stealer Logs, and its unique ranking system (VIP, MVP, GOD), alongside an in-forum transaction credit points system, mirror the operational model of its predecessor, Breached. The forum also implements an escrow system to secure transactions, a strategy that reportedly netted Pompompurin\n$1,000 daily\n.\nThe forum’s significance, however, lies in its membership, including the founders ShinyHunters and other high-profile threat actors. Threat actors such as\nCyberNiggers\nand\nUSDoD\n, known for their claims of breaching major organizations, contribute to the forum’s notoriety and the broader implications for global cybersecurity.\n2 – XSS\nXSS, with a history stretching back to 2013, emerges not only as one of the oldest forums but also as a prominent hub for dangerous threat actors within the Russian-speaking cyber landscape. Established in 2013, the forum underwent a rebranding in 2018, adopting the name XSS in reference to the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability following the arrest of one of its administrators in 2017. Operating as both a TOR and surface web-accessible platform, XSS serves as a bustling hacker forum where discussions revolve around unauthorized access sales, malware, security vulnerabilities, and database trading.\nMain screen of XSS, featuring a BriansClub advertisement banner\nGiven its Russian-speaking user base and notorious reputation, XSS has hosted numerous prominent Russian threat actors, including\nLockBit\n,\nALPHV/BlackCat\n, REvil, and the DarkSide threat group behind the\nColonial Pipeline\ncyberattack. The forum serves as a meeting point for threat actors, facilitating recruitment announcements and various cyber threat exchanges. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) groups and other threat actors utilize XSS for PR purposes, engaging in discussions and promoting their activities to bolster their reputations.\nNotably, underground markets for stolen credit cards, such as\nBidenCash\nand\nBriansClub\n, frequently advertise on this forum. According to comments from threat actors, XSS’s longevity and popularity are attributed to its offshore nature and the admin’s operational security (OPSEC) knowledge, which purportedly enhances forum-wide secrecy and privacy.\nNavigating a Risky and Changing Environment Safely\nMonitoring dark web forums critically underpins the establishment of a proactive defense against cybersecurity threats. This essential vigilance now spans traditional dark web forums, deep web repositories, Telegram channels, underground marketplaces, and ransomware group platforms. SOCRadar\nThreat Hunting\nempowers organizations to navigate and monitor these complex environments safely, avoiding direct exposure.\nThe service identifies potential threats through real-time tracking and sophisticated analysis across a wide range of illicit activities, including data breaches, exposures of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial fraud, and ransomware campaigns. Leveraging advanced search algorithms and customizable news feeds, SOCRadar delivers targeted insights into specific threats.\nSOCRadar Cyber Threat Intelligence Module, Threat Hunting\n3 – LeakBase\nLeakBase emerges as one of the newest and most prominent hacker forums on this list. Estimated to have commenced operations in January 2023, this English-speaking forum accessible on the surface web quickly gained traction, especially following the closure of BreachForums in March 2023. It swiftly stepped in to fill the void in the ever-evolving cybercrime landscape, earning itself a notorious reputation.\nLeakBase’s home screen\nWith a rank system reminiscent of BreachForums and its unique credit point system, LeakBase garnered attention, attracting nearly\n50,000 members\nin a short span. The forum highlights discussions on data leaks, stealer logs, combo lists, vulnerabilities, malware, and even legal tools, each occupying a distinct category.\nIts active community, particularly its members and predominantly its administrative team, fuels its prominence. In fact, according to Daily Dark Web, three of the top threat actors in 2023 were LeakBase members, with the founder of the Chucky forum securing the first position. Moreover, the forum features a dedicated private database section for exclusive content.\nTop 10 Threat Actors in 2023 (Source:\nDaily Dark Web\n)\nAn underline is that it is forbidden to share data about Russia on Leakbase, which may give a little insight into the position of the administrators, or perhaps a deliberate effort to avoid attracting the attention of Russian threat actors. This stance sheds light on the forum’s nuanced approach to managing geopolitical sensitivities while navigating the complex landscape of cybercrime.\n4 – Exploit.in\nEstablished in 2005, Exploit stands as one of the leading Russian hacker forums in the cybercrime sphere, akin to XSS. Operating across TOR and the surface web, Exploit serves as a rendezvous point for initial access brokers, facilitating unauthorized access sales, malware dissemination, security vulnerabilities, and database transactions, either for sale or free distribution.\nMain screen of Exploit\nMuch like XSS, Exploit plays a pivotal role in connecting career-oriented cybercriminals with potential collaborators for illicit ventures, such as hacking, fraud, or involvement in\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\ngroups.\nWith its tightly structured organization and membership policies, Exploit projects an aura of professionalism. This stringent approach has propelled it into the spotlight of the cyber threat landscape, establishing itself as a forum where predominantly genuine content is shared. Non-Russian speakers and amateur threat actors find themselves marginalized within this forum’s community due to its exclusivity.\n5 – Altenen\nAltenen stands out among English-speaking hacker forums accessible on the surface web. Focused on a variety of fraudulent activities, notably credit card fraud, the forum delves into discussions on fraud techniques, cracking, hacking, IT topics, and much more.\nAltenen’s home screen\nEstablished in 2008, Altenen faced a setback when its founder was apprehended in May 2018, leading to the closure of the original forum. However, its successor continues to be actively used. To maintain its activity, Altenen mandates new members to share the forum’s domains on platforms such as X, Youtube, and other social media platforms to activate their memberships, ensuring the forum’s continued operation.\n6- Nulled\nEstablished in 2015, Nulled is a notorious English-language cybercriminal forum prevalent on the dark web. It hosts a variety of illicit content, including leaked data, compromised identities,\ncredit card\ninformation, and tools for illegal activities. Despite its illegal focus, it markets itself as a community for sharing leaks and engaging in discussions.\nNulled’s main page\nIn 2016, Nulled faced infamy due to a major data breach exposing personal user information. Despite the risks, it maintains both public internet-facing and dark web forums, attracting users with varied access levels.\nWhile not as prestigious as other forums like Breach and XSS, Nulled’s broad focus on illicit content ensures its continued relevance in the cybercriminal world.\n7 – RAMP\nEstablished in July 2021,\nRAMP\n(Russian Anonymous Market Place) stands out among dark web forums where Russian, Chinese, and English are spoken. The forum maintains stringent policies for membership, with one of the most crucial being the requirement of a good reputation on XSS and Exploit forums. RAMP surged in popularity by capitalizing on the aftermath of the\nColonial Pipeline\nattack in the US, leveraging its effects on the dark web.\nRAMP’s home page\nFollowing the Colonial Pipeline attack, many hacker forums imposed restrictions on data related to ransomware groups. Serving as a vital point for Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) groups, RAMP carved out a special place under its “partners program” for these groups to conduct activities such as recruiting new hackers or selling initial access. This could be one of the most significant distinctions between RAMP and other forums.\n8 – Cracked\nSubforums of Cracked\nCracked operates as a hacker forum active on the surface web. Conducted in English, discussions on combo lists, vulnerabilities, credentials, and tools are prevalent on this platform. The forum also features\n12 dedicated subforums\nfor different languages, with the French subforum observed to be the most active among them.\n9 – CraxPro\nMain screen of CraxPro\nEstablished in 2020. Conducted in English, within its forum, discussions revolve around topics such as passport/ID sales, cookie, and credential sales, combo lists, SOCKS4 proxy sales, and credit card fraud. While the activity related to credit card fraud may sometimes surpass that of Altenen, threat actors suggest that the distributed credit card information is often inaccurate.\n10 – Dread\nDread’s frontpage\nEstablished in 2018 and conducted in English, Dread was founded by the threat actor known as\nHugBunter\n. Many liken this forum to the “Reddit of the dark web” due to its similar interface. While Dread is one of the largest forums on the dark web, we’ve chosen to place it last on the list. This decision stems from the fact that discussions on drug sales often overshadow hacking-related topics such as database sales, malware sales, and vulnerabilities. However, it’s worth noting that there has been an observed increase in discussions related to hacking topics on Dread at the time of writing this article.\nConclusion: The Critical Role of Dark Web Monitoring\nIn navigating the complexities and hidden dangers of the dark web, the significance of having a robust defense mechanism cannot be overstated.

One of the better-known web-based drug forums,\nThe Hive\n, launched in 1997, serving as an information sharing forum for practical drug synthesis and legal discussion. The Hive was featured in a\nDateline NBC\nspecial called\nThe \"X\" Files\nin 2001, bringing the subject into public discourse.\n[\n12\n]\nFrom 2003, the \"Research Chemical Mailing List\" (RCML) would discuss sourcing \"\nResearch Chemicals\n\" from legal and grey sources as an alternative to forums such as alt.drugs.psychedelics. However\nOperation Web Tryp\nled to a series of website shut downs and arrests in this area.\n[\n13\n]\nSince the year 2000, some of the emerging\ncyber-arms industry\noperates online, including the\nEastern European\n\"\nCyber-arms Bazaar\n\", trafficking in the most powerful\ncrimeware\nand\nhacking tools\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIn the 2000s, early\ncybercrime\nand\ncarding\nforums such as\nShadowCrew\nexperimented with drug wholesaling on a limited scale.\n[\n15\n]\nThe Farmer's Market\nwas launched in 2006 and moved onto Tor in 2010. In 2012, it was closed and several operators and users were arrested as a result of Operation Adam Bomb, a two-year investigation led by the U.S.\nDrug Enforcement Administration\n.\n[\n16\n]\nIt has been considered a \"proto-Silk Road\" but the use of payment services such as\nPayPal\nand\nWestern Union\nallowed law enforcement to trace payments and it was subsequently shut down by the FBI in 2012.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nSilk Road and early markets\nThe first marketplace to use both Tor and Bitcoin escrow was\nSilk Road\n, founded by\nRoss Ulbricht\nunder pseudonym \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" in February 2011.\n[\n19\n]\nIn June 2011,\nGawker\npublished an article about the site,\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\nwhich led to \"Internet buzz\"\n[\n22\n]\nand an increase in website traffic.\n[\n19\n]\nThis in turn led to political pressure from Senator\nChuck Schumer\non the US\nDEA\nand\nDepartment of Justice\nto shut it down,\n[\n23\n]\nwhich they finally did in October 2013 after a lengthy investigation.\n[\n24\n]\nSilk Road's use of all of Tor, Bitcoin escrow and feedback systems would set the standard for new darknet markets for the coming years.\n[\n25\n]\nThe shutdown was described by news site\nDeepDotWeb\nas \"the best advertising the dark net markets could have hoped for\" following the proliferation of competing sites this caused,\n[\n26\n]\nand\nThe Guardian\npredicted others would take over the market that Silk Road previously dominated.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\nThe months and years after Silk Road's closure were marked by a greatly increased number of shorter-lived markets as well as semi-regular law enforcement take downs, hacks, scams and voluntary closures.\nAtlantis\n, the first site to accept\nLitecoin\nas well as Bitcoin, closed in September 2013, just prior to the Silk Road raid, leaving users just one week to withdraw any coins.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nIn October 2013, Project Black Flag closed and stole their users' bitcoins in the panic shortly after Silk Road's shut down.\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\nBlack Market Reloaded\n's popularity increased dramatically after the closure of Silk Road and Sheep Marketplace;\n[\n32\n]\nhowever, in late November 2013, the owner of Black Market Reloaded announced that the website would be taken offline due to the unmanageable influx of new customers this caused.\n[\n33\n]\nSheep Marketplace\n, which launched in March 2013, was one of the lesser known sites to gain popularity with Silk Road's closure.\n[\n34\n]\nNot long after those events, in December 2013, it ceased operation after two Florida men stole $6 million worth of users'\nBitcoins\n.\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nDOJ-OIG Audit (2020-12-18)\nSince Silk Road\nFrom late 2013 through to 2014, new markets started launching with regularity, such as the\nSilk Road 2.0\n, run by the former Silk Road site administrators, as well as the\nAgora\nmarketplace.\n[\n38\n]\n[\n39\n]\nSuch launches were not always a success; in February 2014\nUtopia\n,\n[\n40\n]\nthe highly anticipated market based on Black Market Reloaded,\n[\n41\n]\nopened only to shut down eight days later following rapid actions by Dutch law enforcement.\n[\n42\n]\nFebruary 2014 also marked the short lifespans of Black Goblin Market and CannabisRoad, two sites which closed after being deanonymized without much effort.\n[\n43\n]\nNovember 2014 briefly shook the darknet market ecosystem, when\nOperation Onymous\n, executed by the United States'\nFBI\nand UK's\nNational Crime Agency\n, led to the seizure of 27 hidden sites, including\nSilk Road 2.0\n, one of the largest markets at the time,\n[\n44\n]\nas well 12 smaller markets and individual vendor sites.\n[\n45\n]\nBy September 2014,\nAgora\nwas reported to be the largest market, avoiding\nOperation Onymous\n; as of April 2015\n[update]\n, Agora has gone on to be the largest overall marketplace,\n[\n46\n]\nwith more listings than the Silk Road at its height.\n[\n38\n]\nFurther market diversification occurred in 2015, as did further developments around escrow and decentralization.\nIn March 2015, the\nEvolution\nmarketplace performed an \"\nexit scam\n\", stealing\nescrowed\nbitcoins worth $12 million, half of the ecosystem's listing market share at that time.\n[\n47\n]\nThe closure of Evolution led to a users redistributing to Black Bank and\nAgora\n. However Black Bank, which as of April 2015\n[update]\ncaptured 5% of the darknet market's listings, announced on May 18, 2015, its closure for \"maintenance\"\n[\n48\n]\nbefore disappearing in a similar scam.\n[\n49\n]\nFollowing these events commentators suggested that further market decentralization could be required, such as the service\nOpenBazaar\n, in order to protect buyers and vendors from this risk in the future as well as more widespread support from \"multi-sig\" cryptocurrency payments.\n[\n50\n]\n[\n51\n]\nIn April,\nTheRealDeal\n, the first open\ncyber-arms market\nfor\nsoftware exploits\nas well as drugs, launched to the interest of computer security experts.\n[\n52\n]\nIn May, varied\nDDOS\nattacks were performed against different markets including TheRealDeal. The market owners set up a\nphishing\nwebsite to get the attacker's\npassword\n, and subsequently revealed collaboration between the attacker and the administrator of Mr Nice Guy's market who was also planning to scam his users.\n[\n53\n]\nThis information was revealed to news site\nDeepDotWeb\n.\n[\n54\n]\n[\n55\n]\nOn July 31, the\nItalian police\nin conjunction with\nEuropol\nshut down the\nItalian language\nBabylon\ndarknet market seizing 11,254\nBitcoin\nwallet addresses and 1 million euros.\n[\n56\n]\n[\n57\n]\nAt the end of August, the leading marketplace\nAgora\nannounced its imminent temporary closure after reporting suspicious activity on their server, suspecting some kind of deanonymization bug in\nTor\n.\n[\n58\n]\nBy October 2015,\nAlphaBay\nwas recognized as the largest market.\n[\n59\n]\nFrom then on, through to 2016 there was a period of extended stability for the markets, until in April when the large Nucleus marketplace collapsed for unknown reasons, taking escrowed coins with it.\n[\n60\n]\nOn April 28, investigations into the Italian Darknet Community (IDC) forum-based marketplace led to a number of key arrests.\n[\n61\n]\nIn May 2017, the Bloomsfield Market closed after investigations in Slovakia inadvertently led to the arrests of its operators.\n[\n62\n]\nLater that month, the long-lived Outlaw market closed down citing a major bitcoin\ncryptocurrency wallet\ntheft; however, speculation remained that it was an exit scam.\n[\n63\n]\nIn July 2017, the markets experienced their largest disruptions since\nOperation Onymous\n, when\nOperation Bayonet\nculminated in coordinated multinational seizures of both the\nHansa\nand leading\nAlphaBay\nmarkets, sparking worldwide law enforcement investigations.\n[\n64\n]\nThe seizures brought in lots of traffic to other markets making TradeRoute and Dream Market the most popular markets at the time.\nIn October 2017, TradeRoute exit-scammed shortly after being hacked and extorted.\n[\n65\n]\nIn June 2018, the digital security organization Digital Shadows reported that, due to the climate of fear and mistrust after the closure of AlphaBay and Hansa, darknet market activity was switching away from centralized marketplace websites and towards alternatives such as direct chat on\nTelegram\n, or decentralized marketplaces like\nOpenBazaar\n.\n[\n66\n]\n[\n67\n]\nIn 2019,\nDream Market\nwas the most popular market by far, with over 120,000 current trade listings, followed at one time by Wall Street Market with under 10,000 listings.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nDream Market was shut down in 2019, and Wall Street Market was seized by law enforcement in May 2019\n[\n68\n]\nas part of an Internal Law Enforcement\nOperation Dark Huntor\n.\n[\n69\n]\nThat same operation also shut down the Dark Markets: DeepSea, Berlusconi,\n[\n70\n]\nWhite House and Dark Market.\n[\n71\n]\nThe May 2019 seizure of news and links site\nDeepDotWeb\nfor conspiring with the markets created a temporary disruption around market navigation.\n[\n72\n]\nIn 2021, authorities have taken down the largest dark web marketplace\nDarkMarket\n, along with arresting the Australian man who was believed to be the operator of the website. The 20 servers that hosted the website were seized.\n[\n73\n]\nIn August 2021, AlphaBay was relaunched after the return of one of the original security administrators DeSnake.\n[\n74\n]\nMarket features\nSearch and discussion\nOne of the central\n[\n75\n]\ndiscussion forums\nwas\nReddit\n's /r/DarkNetMarkets/,\n[\n76\n]\n[\n77\n]\n[\n78\n]\nwhich has been the subject of legal investigation, as well as the Tor-based discussion forum,\nThe Hub\n. On March 21, 2018, Reddit administrators shut down the popular subreddit /r/DarkNetMarkets citing new changes to their content policy that forbids the sale of \"Drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, or any controlled substances\".\n[\n79\n]\n[\n80\n]\nThis led to the rise of\nDread\n, the dedicated darknet discussion forum\n[\n81\n]\n[\n72\n]\nand the news site\nDarknetlive\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nMany market places maintain their own dedicated discussion forums and subreddits.\n[\n82\n]\nThe majority of the marketplaces are in English, but some are opening up in Chinese, Russian, and Ukrainian.\n[\n83\n]\nThe dedicated market\nsearch engine\nGrams\nallowed the searching of multiple markets directly without login or registration.\n[\n84\n]\nDark web\nnews and review sites such as the former\n[\n72\n]\nDeepDotWeb\n,\n[\n77\n]\n[\n85\n]\nand\nAll Things Vice\nprovide exclusive interviews and commentary into the dynamic markets.\n[\n86\n]\nUptime and comparison services\n[\n87\n]\nprovide sources of information about active markets as well as suspected\nscams\nand\nlaw enforcement\nactivity. Due to the decentralized nature of these markets,\nphishing\nand scam sites are often maliciously or accidentally referenced.\n[\n88\n]\nAfter discovering the location of a market, a user must register on the site, sometimes with a referral link, after which they can browse listings. A further\nPIN\nmay be required to perform transactions, better protecting users against login credential compromise.\n[\n89\n]\nCustomer interactions\nFlowchart\nof\nThe Silk Road\n's payment system, produced as evidence in the trial of its owner.\nTransactions typically use\nBitcoin\n[\n1\n]\nfor payment, sometimes combined with\ntumblers\n[\n90\n]\nfor added\nanonymity\nand\nPGP\nto secure communications between buyers and vendors from being stored on the site itself.\n[\n91\n]\nMany sites use Bitcoin multisig transactions to improve security and reduce dependency on the site's\nescrow\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe discontinued\nHelix\nBitcoin tumbler\noffered direct anonymized marketplace payment integrations.\n[\n92\n]\nOn making a purchase, the buyer must transfer\ncryptocurrency\ninto the site's\nescrow\n, after which a vendor dispatches their goods then claims the payment from the site. On receipt or non-receipt of the item users may leave\nfeedback\nagainst the vendor's account. Buyers may \"finalize early\" (FE), releasing funds from escrow to the vendor prior to receiving their goods in order to expedite a transaction, but leave themselves vulnerable to fraud if they choose to do so.\n[\n89\n]\nFollowing\nOperation Onymous\n, there was a substantial increase in\nPGP\nsupport from vendors, with PGP use on two marketplaces near 90%. This suggests that law enforcement responses to cryptomarkets result in continued security innovations, thereby making markets more resilient to undercover law enforcement efforts.\n[\n93\n]\nMarket types\nItems on a typical centralized darknet market are listed from a range of vendors in an\neBay\n-like marketplace format.\n[\n94\n]\nVirtually all such markets have advanced reputation, search and shipping features similar to\nAmazon.com\n.\n[\n95\n]\nBy 2015, some of the most popular vendors had their own dedicated online shops separate from the large marketplaces.\n[\n96\n]\nIndividual sites had returned to operating on the\nclearnet\n, with mixed success.\n[\n97\n]\nSome\ncriminal internet forums\nsuch as the defunct\nTor Carding Forum\n[\n98\n]\nand the\nRussian Anonymous Marketplace\nfunction as markets with trusted members providing escrow services, and users engaging in off-forum messaging.\n[\n99\n]\nIn May 2014 the \"Deepify\" service attempted to automate the process of setting up markets with a\nSAAS\nsolution;\n[\n100\n]\nhowever, this closed a short time later.\n[\n101\n]\nFollowing repeated problems associated with centralized infrastructure, a number of\ndecentralized\nmarketplace software alternatives were set up using\nblockchain\nor\npeer-to-peer\ntechnologies, including\nOpenBazaar\n[\n51\n]\nand Bitmarkets,\n[\n102\n]\nVendors\nTo list on a market, a\nvendor\nmay have undergone an\napplication process\nvia referral, proof of reputation from another market or given a cash deposit to the market.\n[\n94\n]\nMany vendors list their wares on multiple markets, ensuring they retain their reputation even should a single market place close.\nGrams\nhave launched \"InfoDesk\" to allow central content and identity management for vendors as well as\nPGP\nkey distribution.\n[\n103\n]\n[\n93\n]\nMeanwhile, individual law enforcement operations regularly investigate and arrest individual vendors\n[\n104\n]\nand those purchasing significant quantities for personal use.\n[\n105\n]\nA February 2016 report suggested that a quarter of all DNM purchases were for resale.\n[\n9\n]\nProducts\nAn analysis of the defunct\nEvolution\nmarketplace shows the different types of products and vendors on a market\n[\n106\n]\nDrugs\nMain article:\nIllegal drug trade\nWhilst a great many products are sold, drugs dominate the numbers of listings, with the drugs including\ncannabis\n,\nMDMA\n,\nmodafinil\n,\n[\n107\n]\n[\n108\n]\n[\n109\n]\nLSD\n, cocaine, and\ndesigner drugs\n.\nPersonal information\nPersonally identifying information\n, financial information like credit card and bank account information, and medical data from\nmedical data breaches\nis bought and sold, mostly in darknet markets but also in other\nblack markets\n.\n[\n110\n]\nPeople increase the value of the stolen data by aggregating it with publicly available data, and sell it again for a profit, increasing the damage that can be done to the people whose data was stolen.\n[\n111\n]\nFraud and hacking services\nMain article:\nCarding (fraud)\nCyber crime and hacking services for financial institutions and banks have also been offered over the dark web.\n[\n112\n]\nMarkets such as\nAlphaBay Market\nhave hosted a significant share of the commercial\nfraud\nmarket, featuring\ncarding\n,\ncounterfeiting\nand many related services.\n[\n113\n]\nLoyalty card\ninformation is also sold as it is easy to launder.\n[\n114\n]\nProhibitions and restrictions\nMany markets refuse to list weapons\n[\n115\n]\nor\npoisons\n.\n[\n116\n]\nMarkets such as the original Silk Road would refuse to list anything where the \"purpose is to harm or defraud, such as\nstolen credit cards\n, assassinations, and weapons of mass destruction\".\n[\n22\n]\nLater markets such as\nEvolution\nban \"child pornography, services related to murder/assassination/terrorism, prostitution, Ponzi schemes, and lotteries\", but allow the wholesaling of credit card data.\n[\n47\n]\nThe market in firearms appears to attract extra attention from law enforcement,\n[\n117\n]\nas does the selling of other weapons such as certain types of knives and blades.\n[\n118\n]\nMarket operations\nNachash, former proprietor of\nDoxbin\n, wrote a guide in early 2015 entitled\nSo, You Want To Be a Darknet Drug Lord ...\n[\n119\n]\n[\n120\n]\nBackground research tasks included learning from past\ndrug lords\n, researching legal matters, studying law enforcement agency tactics and obtaining legal representation. With regards to the prospective market's hosting, he recommends identifying a hosting country with gaps in their\nmutual legal assistance treaty\nwith one's country of residence, avoiding overpriced\nbulletproof hosting\nand choosing a\nweb host\nwith\nTor\nsupport that accepts suitably hard-to-trace payment. Patterns recommended to avoid include hiring\nhitmen\nlike\nDread Pirate Roberts\n, and sharing\nhandles\nfor software questions on sites like\nStack Exchange\n.\nHe advises on running a secured server operating system with a server-side transparent Tor proxy server,\n[\n121\n]\nhardening web application configurations, Tor-based\nserver administration\n, automated server\nconfiguration management\nrebuild and secure destruction with frequent server relocation rather than a darknet managed hosting service.\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\nTo protect against guard\nnode\ndeanonymization he recommends obfuscating traffic by investing in Tor relays which the market site will exclusively use.\nFor a local machine configuration, he recommends a computer purchased for cash running\nLinux\n, using a local Tor transparent proxy. For\noperations security\nhe suggests avoiding storing conversation logs, varying\nwriting styles\n, avoiding mobile phone-based tracking and leaking false personal details to further obfuscate one's identity. Use of\nOTR\nand\nPGP\nare recommended.\nHe recommends verifying market employees carefully, and to weed out law enforcement infiltration through\nbarium meal tests\n.\nLaw enforcement and intelligence agencies have expanded investigations of dark web markets,\n[\n124\n]\n[\n125\n]\nFraudulent markets\nA large number of services pretend to be a legitimate vendor shop, or marketplace of some kind in order to defraud people. These include the notoriously unreliable gun stores,\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nor even fake\nassassination\nwebsites.\n[\n126\n]\nExit scams\nGraphical illustration of the life-cycle of vendors\n[\n127\n]\nCentralized market escrow allows a market to close down and \"\nexit\n\" with the buyer's and vendor's cryptocurrency at any time. This has happened on several occasions such as with BlackBank,\n[\n48\n]\nEvolution\n,\n[\n47\n]\nand Wall Street Market.\n[\n128\n]\nIndividual vendors often reach a point of reputation maturity whereby they have sold sufficient product reliably to have gained a significant reputation and accumulated escrowed funds; many may choose to exit with the funds rather than compete at the higher-volume higher-priced matured product level.\n[\n127\n]\n[\n129\n]\nCommentary\nIn December 2014, an exhibition by Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo entitled \"The Darknet: From Memes to Onionland\" explored\nDarknet\nculture. This featured a\nbot\ncalled the \"Random Darknet Shopper\" which spent $100 in\nBTC\nper week on products listed on\nAgora\n.\n[\n130\n]\nTheir aim was to explore the ethical and philosophical implications of these markets, which, despite high-profile internationally co-ordinated raids, persist and flourish.\n[\n131\n]\nJames Martin's 2014 book\nDrugs on the Dark Net: How Cryptomarkets are Transforming the Global Trade in Illicit Drugs\ndiscusses some vendors who are even branding their opium or cocaine as \"\nfair trade\n\", \"\norganic\n\" or sourced from conflict-free zones.\n[\n132\n]\nIn June 2015 journalist\nJamie Bartlett\ngave a\nTED talk\nabout the state of the darknet market ecosystem as it stood at the time.\n[\n133\n]\nAccording to 2014 studies by Martin\n[\n134\n]\n[\n132\n]\nAldridge & Décary-Hétu\n[\n135\n]\nand a January 2015 report from the Global Drug Policy Observatory, many\nharm reduction\ntrends have been spotted. These include the reduced risks associated with street dealing such as being offered\nhard drugs\n. The vendor feedback system provides accountability for risks of mixing and side effects and protection against scammers. Online forum communities provide information about safe drug use in an environment where users can anonymously ask questions. Some users report the online element having a moderating effect on their consumption due to the increased\nlead time\nordering from the sites compared to street dealing.\n[\n136\n]\nProfessor for addiction research Heino Stöver notes that the shops can be seen as a political statement, advancing\ndrug legalization\n\"from below\".\n[\n137\n]\nThe results of these markets are higher quality and lower prices of psychoactive substances as well as a lower risk of violent incidents.\n[\n138\n]\nA number of studies suggest that markets such as Silk Road may have helped users reduce the harm caused by illicit drug use, particularly compared with street-based drug marketplaces. Examples include the sale of high-quality products with low risk for contamination (including\nlacing\nand\ncutting\n), vendor-tested products, sharing of trip reports, and online discussion of harm reduction practices. Some health professionals such as \"DoctorX\" provide information, advice and drug-testing services on the darknet.\n[\n139\n]\nThe quality of products is attributed to the competition and transparency of darknet markets\n[\n138\n]\nwhich involve user feedback and reputation features.\nEuropol\nreported in December 2014, \"We have lately seen a large amount of physical crime move online, at least the 'marketing' and delivery part of the business ... [Buyers can] get the illegal commodity delivered risk-free to a place of their choice by the mailman or a courier, or maybe by drone in the future, and can pay with virtual currency and in full anonymity, without the police being able to identify either the buyer or the seller.\"\n[\n95\n]\nIn June 2015 the\nEuropean Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction\n(EMCDDA) produced a report citing difficulties controlling virtual market places via darknet markets, social media and mobile apps.\n[\n140\n]\nIn August 2015 it was announced that\nInterpol\nnow offers a dedicated Dark Web training program featuring technical information on Tor and\ncybersecurity\nand simulated darknet market takedowns.\nIn October 2015 the UK's\nNational Crime Agency\nand\nGCHQ\nannounced the formation of a \"\nJoint Operations Cell\n\" to focus on cybercrime.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nIn November 2015 this team would be tasked with tackling child exploitation on the dark web as well as other cybercrime.\n[\n141\n]\nIn February 2015, the EMCDDA produced another report citing the increased importance of customer service and reputation management in the marketplace, the reduced risk of violence and increased product purity. It estimated a quarter of all purchases were for resale and that the trend towards decentralization meant they are unlikely to be eliminated any time soon.\n[\n9\n]\nA June 2016 report from the Global Drug Survey described how the markets are increasing in popularity, despite ongoing law enforcement action and scams. Other findings include consumers making purchases via friends operating\nTor\nbrowser and\nBitcoin\npayments, rather than directly. Access to markets in 79% of respondents' cases led to users trying a new type of drug.\n[\n142\n]\nA 2017 study focused on a\ngeographical\nanalysis of trafficking on a darknet market. Researchers contended that previous studies have demonstrated variations in the types of substances available in different countries. These variations can be attributed to factors like geographic isolation, strict\nborder controls\n, lenient laws on illegal items, high prices, tight internet control, and the general accessibility of illegal goods.\n[\n143\n]\nSize of listings\nThe size of the darknet markets economy can be problematic to estimate. A study based on a combination of listing scrapes and feedback to estimate sales volume by researchers at\nCarnegie Mellon University\ncaptured some of the best data. A reviewed 2013 analysis put the Silk Road\ngrossing\n$300,000 a day, extrapolating to over $100 million over a year. Subsequent data from later markets has significant gaps as well as complexities associated with analysing multiple marketplaces.\n[\n144\n]\n18,174 – October 2013,\nDigital Citizens Alliance\n,\n[\n26\n]\n13,472 of which were on Silk Road in November 2013\n[\n1\n]\n41,207 – April 2014 Digital Citizens Alliance\n[\n145\n]\n33,985 – May 2014\nThe Guardian\nvia\nReddit\n[\n146\n]\n43,175 – July 2014 a report by the\nBBC\n[\n26\n]\n65,595 – August 2014 Digital Citizens Alliance\n[\n147\n]\n51,755 – December 2014 Digital Citizens Alliance\n[\n148\n]\n68,835 – March 2015 (before\nEvolution\nscam), Digital Citizens Alliance\n[\n46\n]\n68,322 – April 2015 (after Evolution scam)\n[\n46\n]\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nOctober 2013\nApril 2014\nAugust 2014\nNovember 2014\nMarch 2015\nApril 2015\nSilk Road\nBlack Market Reloaded\nSheep\nDeepBay\nAgora\nPandora\nEvolution\nTOM\nMiddle Earth\nNucleus\nAbraxas\nBlack Bank\nAlpha Bay\nOthers\nDigital Citizens Alliance\n[\n149\n]\nIn fiction\nIn the episode \"\neps2.3_logic-b0mb.hc\n\" (ep. 5 of season 2) of the drama–thriller television series,\nMr. Robot\n, the protagonist, Elliot, is supposed to be repairing a Tor hidden site which turns out to be a darknet market called \"Midland City\" styled after the Silk Road for the sale of guns, sex trafficked women, rocket launchers, drugs and hitmen for hire.\n[\n150\n]\n[\n151\n]\nIn the 2016 movie\nNerve\nstarring Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, the dark web plays a major role.\nIn\nGrand Theft Auto Online\n, players who purchase warehouses and garages for illicit cargo and stolen cars can buy/steal and sell them through trade on the \"SecuroServ\" syndicate website.

For the part of the Internet not accessible by traditional web search engines, see\nDeep web\n. For the comic book storyline, see\nDark Web (Marvel Comics)\n.\nThe\ndark web\nis the\nWorld Wide Web\ncontent that exists on\ndarknets\n(\noverlay networks\n) that use the\nInternet\nbut require specific software, configurations, or\nauthorization\nto access.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nThrough the dark web, private computer networks can communicate and conduct business anonymously without divulging identifying information, such as a user's location.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nThe dark web forms a small part of the\ndeep web\n, the part of the web not\nindexed\nby\nweb search engines\n, although sometimes the term\ndeep web\nis mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n2\n]\n[\n8\n]\nThe darknets which constitute the dark web include small,\nfriend-to-friend\nnetworks, as well as large, popular networks such as\nTor\n,\nHyphanet\n,\nI2P\n, and\nRiffle\noperated by public organizations and individuals.\n[\n6\n]\nUsers of the dark web refer to the regular web as\nclearnet\ndue to its\nunencrypted\nnature.\n[\n9\n]\nThe Tor dark web or\nonionland\n[\n10\n]\nuses the traffic anonymization technique of\nonion routing\nunder the network's\ntop-level domain\nsuffix\n.onion\n.\nTerminology\nDefinition\nMain article:\nDarknet\nThe dark web has often been confused with the\ndeep web\n, the parts of the web not indexed (searchable) by search engines. The term\ndark web\nfirst emerged in 2009; however, it is unknown when the actual dark web first emerged.\n[\n11\n]\nMany internet users only use the\nsurface web\n, data that can be accessed by a typical\nweb browser\n.\n[\n12\n]\nThe dark web forms a small part of the deep web, but requires custom software in order to access its content. This confusion dates back to at least 2009.\n[\n13\n]\nSince then, especially in reporting on\nSilk Road\n, the two terms have often been conflated,\n[\n14\n]\ndespite recommendations that they should be distinguished.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n7\n]\nTor\nsoftware logo\nThe dark web, also known as darknet websites, are accessible only through networks such as\nTor\n(\"The Onion Routing\" project) that are created specifically for the dark web.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n15\n]\nTor browser and Tor-accessible sites are widely used among the darknet users and can be identified by the domain \".onion\".\n[\n16\n]\nTor browsers create encrypted entry points and pathways for the user, allowing their dark web searches and actions to be anonymous.\n[\n12\n]\nIdentities and locations of darknet users stay anonymous and cannot be tracked due to the layered\nencryption\nsystem. The darknet encryption technology routes users' data through a large number of intermediate servers, which protects the users' identity and guarantees anonymity. The transmitted information can be decrypted only by a subsequent\nnode\nin the scheme, which leads to the exit node. The complicated system makes it almost impossible to reproduce the node path and decrypt the information layer by layer.\n[\n17\n]\nDue to the high level of encryption, websites are not able to track\ngeolocation\nand IP of their users, and users are not able to get this information about the host. Thus, communication between darknet users is highly encrypted allowing users to talk, blog, and share files confidentially.\n[\n18\n]\nContent\nWeb-based\nonion services\nin February 2016\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nCategory\n% of total\n% of active\nViolence\n0.3\n0.6\nArms\n0.8\n1.5\nIllicit Social\n1.2\n2.4\nHacking\n1.8\n3.5\nIllicit links\n2.3\n4.3\nIllicit pornography\n2.3\n4.5\nExtremism\n2.7\n5.1\nIllicit Other\n3.8\n7.3\nIllicit Finance\n6.3\n12\nIllicit Drugs\n8.1\n15.5\nNon-illicit+Unknown\n22.6\n43.2\nIllicit total\n29.7\n56.8\nInactive\n47.7\nActive\n52.3\nA December 2014 study by Gareth Owen from the\nUniversity of Portsmouth\nfound that the most commonly hosted type of content on Tor was\nchild pornography\n, followed by\nblack markets\n, while the individual sites with the highest traffic were dedicated to\nbotnet\noperations (see attached metric).\n[\n21\n]\nMany\nwhistleblowing\nsites maintain a presence\n[\n22\n]\nas well as political discussion forums.\n[\n23\n]\nSites associated with\nBitcoin\n,\nfraud\n-related services, and\nmail order\nservices are some of the most prolific.\n[\n21\n]\nAs of December 2020, the number of active Tor sites in .onion was estimated at 76,300 (containing a lot of copies). Of these, 18 000 would have original content.\n[\n24\n]\nIn July 2017,\nRoger Dingledine\n, one of the three founders of the Tor Project, said that\nFacebook\nis the biggest hidden service. The dark web comprises only 3% of the traffic in the Tor network.\n[\n25\n]\nA February 2016 study from researchers at\nKing's College London\ngives the following breakdown of content by an alternative category set, highlighting the illicit use of .onion services.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n26\n]\nRansomware\nThe dark web is also used in certain extortion-related processes. It is common to observe data from\nransomware\nattacks on several dark web sites, for example data sales sites or public data repository sites.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\nBotnets\nBotnets\nare often structured with their\ncommand-and-control\nservers based on a censorship-resistant hidden service, creating a large amount of bot-related traffic.\n[\n21\n]\n[\n29\n]\nDarknet markets\nMain article:\nDarknet market\nCommercial\ndarknet markets\nmediate transactions for illegal goods and typically use Bitcoin as payment.\n[\n30\n]\nThese markets have attracted significant media coverage, starting with the popularity of\nSilk Road\nand Diabolus Market and its subsequent seizure by legal authorities.\n[\n31\n]\nSilk Road was one of the first dark web marketplaces that emerged in 2011 and has allowed for the trading of weapons and identity fraud resources.\n[\n30\n]\nThese markets have no protection for its users and can be closed down at any time by authorities.\n[\n30\n]\nDespite the closures of these marketplaces, others pop up in their place.\n[\n30\n]\nAs of 2020, there have been at least 38 active dark web market places.\n[\n30\n]\nThese marketplaces are similar to that of\neBay\nor\nCraigslist\nwhere users can interact with sellers and leave reviews about marketplace products.\n[\n30\n]\nExamination of price differences in dark web markets versus prices in real life or over the World Wide Web have been attempted as well as studies in the quality of goods received over the dark web. One such study was performed on Evolution, one of the most popular\ncrypto-markets\nactive from January 2013 to March 2015.\n[\n32\n]\nAlthough it found the digital information, such as concealment methods and shipping country, \"seems accurate\", the study uncovered issues with the quality of illegal drugs sold in Evolution, stating that, \"the illicit drugs purity is found to be different from the information indicated on their respective listings.\"\n[\n32\n]\nLess is known about consumer motivations for accessing these marketplaces and factors associated with their use.\n[\n33\n]\nDarknets markets also sell leaked credit cards\n[\n34\n]\nthat can be downloaded for free or purchased for use in illegal activities.\nBitcoin services\nBitcoin\nis one of the main cryptocurrencies used in dark web marketplaces due to the flexibility and relative anonymity of the currency.\n[\n35\n]\nWith bitcoin, people can hide their intentions as well as their identity.\n[\n36\n]\nA common approach was to use a\ndigital currency exchanger\nservice which converted bitcoin into an online game currency (such as gold coins in\nWorld of Warcraft\n) that will later be converted back into fiat currency.\n[\n37\n]\n[\n38\n]\nBitcoin\nservices such as\ntumblers\nare often available on\nTor\n, and some – such as\nGrams\n– offer darknet market integration.\n[\n39\n]\n[\n40\n]\nA research study undertaken by Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at\nESSEC\n, and carried out with the\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\n, highlighted new trends in the use of bitcoin tumblers for\nmoney laundering\npurposes.\nDue to its relevance in the digital world, bitcoin has become a popular product for users to scam companies with.\n[\n35\n]\nCybercriminal groups such as DDOS\"4\" have led to over 140 cyberattacks on companies since the emergence of bitcoins in 2014.\n[\n35\n]\nThese attacks have led to the formation of other cybercriminal groups as well as Cyber Extortion.\n[\n35\n]\nHacking groups and services\nMany\nhackers\nsell their services either individually or as a part of groups.\n[\n41\n]\nSuch groups include\nxDedic\n,\nhackforum\n, Trojanforge,\nMazafaka\n,\ndark0de\nand the\nTheRealDeal\ndarknet market.\n[\n42\n]\nSome have been known to\ntrack\nand\nextort\napparent pedophiles.\n[\n43\n]\nCyber crimes and hacking services for financial institutions and banks have also been offered over the dark web.\n[\n44\n]\nAttempts to monitor this activity have been made through various government and private organizations, and an examination of the tools used can be found in the\nProcedia Computer Science\njournal.\n[\n45\n]\nUse of Internet-scale DNS distributed reflection denial of service (\nDRDoS\n) attacks have also been made through leveraging the dark web.\n[\n46\n]\nThere are many scam .onion sites also present which end up giving tools for download that are infected with\ntrojan horses\nor\nbackdoors\n.\nRecently, around 100,000 compromised ChatGPT users' login information was sold on the dark web in 2023. Additionally, the logs showed, in the opinion of the researchers, that the majority of the compromised ChatGPT passwords had been extracted by the data-stealing virus Raccoon.\n[\n47\n]\nFinancing and fraud\nScott Dueweke the president and founder of Zebryx Consulting states that Russian electronic currency such as WebMoney and Perfect Money are behind the majority of the illegal actions.\n[\n36\n]\nIn April 2015, Flashpoint received a 5 million dollar investment to help their clients gather intelligence from the deep and dark web.\n[\n48\n]\nThere are numerous\ncarding\nforums\n,\nPayPal\nand\nbitcoin\ntrading websites as well as fraud and counterfeiting services.\n[\n49\n]\nMany such sites are scams themselves.\n[\n50\n]\nPhishing\nvia cloned websites and other\nscam\nsites are numerous,\n[\n51\n]\n[\n52\n]\nwith\ndarknet markets\noften advertised with fraudulent URLs.\n[\n53\n]\n[\n54\n]\nIllegal pornography\nThe type of content that has the most popularity on the dark web is illegal pornography—more specifically,\nchild pornography\n.\n[\n35\n]\nAbout 80% of its web traffic is related to accessing child pornography despite it being difficult to find even on the dark web.\n[\n35\n]\nA website called\nLolita City\n, which has since been taken down, contained over 100 GB of child pornographic media and had about 15,000 members.\n[\n35\n]\nThere is regular\nlaw enforcement\naction against sites distributing child pornography\n[\n55\n]\n[\n56\n]\n– often via compromising the site and tracking users'\nIP addresses\n.\n[\n57\n]\n[\n58\n]\nIn 2015, the FBI investigated and took down a website called\nPlaypen\n.\n[\n35\n]\nAt the time, Playpen was the largest child pornography website on the dark web with over 200,000 members.\n[\n35\n]\nSites use complex systems of guides, forums and community regulation.\n[\n59\n]\nOther content includes\nsexualised torture and killing of animals\n[\n60\n]\nand\nrevenge porn\n.\n[\n61\n]\nIn May 2021,\nGerman police\nsaid that they had dismantled one of the world's biggest child pornography networks on the dark web known as\nBoystown\n; the website had over 400,000 registered users. Four people had been detained in raids, including a man from\nParaguay\n, on suspicion of running the network.\nEuropol\nsaid several pedophile chat sites were also taken down in the German-led intelligence operation.\n[\n62\n]\n[\n63\n]\nTerrorism\nTerrorist organizations took to the internet as early as the 1990s; however, the birth of the dark web attracted these organizations due to the anonymity, lack of regulation, social interaction, and easy accessibility.\n[\n64\n]\nThese groups have been taking advantage of the chat platforms within the dark web to inspire terrorist attacks.\n[\n64\n]\nGroups have even posted \"How To\" guides, teaching people how to become and hide their identities as terrorists.\n[\n64\n]\nThe dark web became a forum for terrorist propaganda, guiding information, and most importantly, funding.\n[\n64\n]\nWith the introduction of Bitcoin, an anonymous transactions were created which allowed for anonymous donations and funding.\n[\n64\n]\nBy accepting Bitcoin, terrorists were now able to fund purchases of weaponry.\n[\n64\n]\nIn 2018, an individual named Ahmed Sarsur was charged for attempting to purchase explosives and hire snipers to aid Syrian terrorists, as well as attempting to provide them financial support, all through the dark web.\n[\n35\n]\nThere are at least some real and fraudulent websites claiming to be used by\nISIL\n(ISIS), including a fake one seized in\nOperation Onymous\n.\n[\n65\n]\nWith the increase of technology, it has allowed cyber terrorists to flourish by attacking the weaknesses of the technology.\n[\n66\n]\nIn the wake of the\nNovember 2015 Paris attacks\n, an actual such site was hacked by an\nAnonymous\n-affiliated hacker group,\nGhostSec\n, and replaced with an advert for\nProzac\n.\n[\n67\n]\nThe\nRawti Shax\nIslamist group was found to be operating on the dark web at one time.\n[\n68\n]\nSocial media\nWithin the dark web, there exists emerging social media platforms similar to those on the World Wide Web, this is known as the Dark Web Social Network (DWSN).\n[\n69\n]\nThe DWSN works a like a regular social networking site where members can have customizable pages, have friends, like posts, and blog in forums.\nFacebook\nand other traditional social media platforms have begun to make dark-web versions of their websites to address problems associated with the traditional platforms and to continue their service in all areas of the World Wide Web.\n[\n70\n]\nUnlike Facebook, the privacy policy of the DWSN requires that members are to reveal absolutely no personal information and remain anonymous.\n[\n69\n]\nHoaxes and unverified content\nThere are reports of\ncrowdfunded assassinations\nand\nhitmen\nfor hire;\n[\n71\n]\n[\n72\n]\nhowever, these are believed to be exclusively scams.\n[\n73\n]\n[\n74\n]\nThe creator of\nSilk Road\n,\nRoss Ulbricht\n, was arrested by Homeland Security investigations (HSI) for his site and allegedly hiring a hitman to kill six people, although the charges were later dropped.\n[\n75\n]\n[\n76\n]\nThere is an\nurban legend\nthat one can find\nlive murder\non the dark web. The term \"\nRed Room\n\" has been coined based on the Japanese animation and urban legend of the same name; however, the evidence points toward all reported instances being\nhoaxes\n.\n[\n77\n]\n[\n78\n]\nOn June 25, 2015, the\nindie game\nSad Satan\nwas reviewed by YouTubers\nObscure Horror Corner\nwhich they claimed to have found via the dark web. Various inconsistencies in the channel's reporting cast doubt on the reported version of events.\n[\n79\n]\nThere are several websites which analyze and monitor the deep web and dark web for threat intelligence.\n[\n80\n]\nPolicing the dark web\nThere have been arguments that the dark web promotes civil liberties, like \"free speech, privacy, anonymity\".\n[\n5\n]\nSome prosecutors and government agencies are concerned that it is a haven for\ncriminal activity\n.\n[\n81\n]\nThe deep and dark web are applications of integral internet features to provide privacy and anonymity. Policing involves targeting specific activities of the private web deemed illegal or subject to\ninternet censorship\n.\nWhen investigating online suspects, police typically use the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the individual; however, due to Tor browsers creating anonymity, this becomes an impossible tactic.\n[\n82\n]\nAs a result, law enforcement has employed many other tactics in order to identify and arrest those engaging in illegal activity on the dark web.\n[\n83\n]\nOSINT\n, or Open Source Intelligence, are data collection tools that legally collect information from public sources.\n[\n82\n]\nOSINT tools can be dark web specific to help officers find bits of information that would lead them to gaining more knowledge about interactions going on in the dark web.\n[\n82\n]\nIn 2015 it was announced that\nInterpol\nnow offers a dedicated dark web training program featuring technical information on Tor,\ncybersecurity\nand simulated darknet market takedowns.\n[\n84\n]\nIn October 2013 the UK's\nNational Crime Agency\nand\nGCHQ\nannounced the formation of a \"\nJoint Operations Cell\n\" to focus on cybercrime. In November 2015 this team would be tasked with tackling child exploitation on the dark web as well as other cybercrime.\n[\n85\n]\nIn March 2017 the\nCongressional Research Service\nreleased an extensive report on the dark web, noting the changing dynamic of how information is accessed and presented on it; characterized by the unknown, it is of increasing interest to researchers, law enforcement, and policymakers.\n[\n86\n]\nIn August 2017, according to reportage, cybersecurity firms which specialize in monitoring and researching the dark web on behalf of banks and retailers routinely share their findings with the\nFBI\nand with other law enforcement agencies \"when possible and necessary\" regarding illegal content. The Russian-speaking underground offering a crime-as-a-service model is regarded as being particularly robust.\n[\n87\n]\nJournalism\nMany\njournalists\n, alternative\nnews organizations\n, educators, and researchers are influential in their writing and speaking of the darknet, and making its use clear to the general public.\n[\n88\n]\n[\n89\n]\nMedia coverage typically reports on the dark web in two ways; detailing the power and freedom of speech the dark web allows people to express, or more commonly reaffirms the illegality and fear of its contents, such as computer hackers.\n[\n69\n]\nMany headlines tie the dark web to child pornography with headlines such as, \"N.J. man charged with surfing 'Dark Web' to collect nearly 3K images of child porn\",\n[\n90\n]\nalong with other illegal activities where news outlets describe it as \"a hub for black markets that sell or distribute drugs\".\n[\n91\n]\n[\n69\n]\nSpecialist\nClearweb\nnews sites such as\nDeepDotWeb\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nand\nAll Things Vice\n[\n94\n]\nprovide news coverage and practical information about dark web sites and services; however,\nDeepDotWeb\nwas shut down by authorities in 2019.\n[\n95\n]\nThe Hidden Wiki\nand its\nmirrors\nand\nforks\nhold some of the largest\ndirectories\nof content at any given time. Traditional media and news channels such as\nABC News\nhave also featured articles examining the darknet.\n[\n96\n]\n[\n97\n]\nSee also\nList of Tor onion services\nTor (network)\nReferences\n^\na\nb\n\"Going Dark: The Internet Behind The Internet\"\n.\nNPR\n. 25 May 2014.\nArchived\nfrom the original on 27 May 2015\n.

Listed below are  the responsibilities of the Cyber Crimes Unit.\nContact the Cyber Crimes Unit: (609) 584-5051 ext. 5664\nCyber Crimes Unit Responsibilities\nThe mission of the Cyber Crimes Unit is to conduct and assist in investigations where computers, networks, telecommunication devices, and other technological instruments are the vehicle or target for the commission of criminal acts against network resources  critical to the function of corporate or government entities. These vehicle or  target intrusions lead the unit to specialize in the investigations of:\nSuspicious Network Traffic\nComputer Intrusions\nData Theft\nOnline ID Theft\nUnlawful Access\nAccount Hijacking\nCyber Terrorism\nCyber Stalking\nInternal Compromises\nSocial Networking/Email Account Intrusions\nRomance Scams\nBusiness Email Compromise\nCryptocurrency\nRelated Links\nImportant Cyber Crime Information Links\nThe Internet Crime Complaint Center\nIdentity Theft\nBusinesses Reporting A Breach Of Security\nRomance Scams\nBusiness Email Compromise\nCryptocurrency\nTraining is provided for State Police enlisted and civilian personnel, and other law enforcement agencies throughout the state regarding network intrusion-related crimes and their impact on government and business. Additionally, training is provided to civic, business, and   educational organizations  regarding computers and safety on the Internet.\nCorporate outreach services are provided to educate  and inform corporate entities, as well as institutions of higher education within the State, of the dangers and vulnerabilities of wired and wireless  networks. A state cyber-crimes response group has been established and   maintained for incident response statewide, in the event of significant network intrusion. A positive and fruitful working relationship with the New Jersey Office of Information Technology\nallows the unit to address cyber vulnerabilities and respond.\nWith the growing popularity and use of computers, the  unit has seen a significant increase in conducting and assisting with investigations where computers are being  utilized for the commission of fraud and identify theft. Furthermore, the unit collaborates with and assists federal, state, and  local law enforcement in enforcing  federal, state, and local criminal laws relating to computer-related crime through the forensic collection, recovery,  processing, preservation, analysis, storage, maintenance, and presentation of digital evidence.\nTraining and education are provided for federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel and prosecutors regarding the forensic examination of digital evidence as it relates to the investigation and prosecution of computer-related or technology-facilitated crime.\nBack\n|\nTop\nImportant Cyber Crime Information Links\nhttps://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx\nhttps://cyber.nj.gov/\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/\nhttps://www.justice.gov/criminal/  fraud/websites/idtheft.html\nhttps://www.antiphishing.org/\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/sentinel/\nhttps://www.us-cert.gov/\nNew Jersey Computer Crime Statutes\n- [pdf]\nhttps://www.identitytheft.gov/\nBack\n|\nTop\nIdentity Theft\nIdentity theft is a serious problem affecting millions of people each year. It involves acquiring key pieces of someone's identifying   information,\nsuch as name, address, date of birth, social security number and mother's maiden name, to impersonate them. This information enables the identity thief to commit numerous forms of fraud which include, but are not limited to, taking over the victim's financial accounts, opening new bank accounts, purchasing automobiles, applying for loans, credit cards and social security benefits, renting apartments, and establishing services with utility and phone companies.\nRead more information on our identity theft victim's reference guide.\nBack\n|\nTop\nBusinesses Reporting a Breach of Security\nThe Identity Theft Prevention Act, effective January 1, 2006, requires businesses that operate, or have clients in New Jersey, disclose a breach of security to customers. However, the act requires these businesses to report the breach to the Division of State Police for investigation or handling, prior to disclosure to the customer. The Data Breach Notification Procedures link provides the proper procedure for reporting a loss of personal identification.\nPlease follow the link below to view information about:\nData Breach Notification Procedures\nThe Identity Theft Prevention Act\nFor questions concerning potential criminal acts resulting in data breaches in New Jersey, contact the State Police Cyber Crime Unit at:\n(609) 584-5051 x5664\nFor questions concerning the Data Breach Notification Procedure please call the New Jersey Cybersecurity & Communications Integration Cell at:\n(609) 963-6900 x7865\nBack\n|\nTop\nRomance Scams\nA romance scam is when scammers create fake profiles on dating apps or social media sites with the intention of building relationships with you through talking for extended periods of time. Then, the scammer may generate a story as to why they need money in hopes of having you send it to them. In 2021, $547 million dollars were lost to romance scams which is an 80% increase from reports in 2020.\nSome steps can be taken to avoid being a victim of romance scammers. It is essential to check in on those most vulnerable such as older loved ones, those living alone, and those grieving the loss of a partner.\nYou should limit what is shared online and avoid oversharing personal information. Do your research on the person you are talking to. Search their name in a general Google search and see if anything suspicious comes up. Ask many questions and be wary if they have excuses for not meeting with you in person. Take warning in those who seem too perfect or ask you to leave a dating platform to communicate directly. These scammers are known for attempting to isolate you from those you are close to and may request inappropriate photos or financial information. Never send money to anyone you have only communicated with online or over the phone.\nIf you think you are a victim of a romance scam, you should stop talking to the person immediately and talk with someone you trust to describe the situation. It is important to report the incident to your local law enforcement and submit a fraud complaint to the Federal Trade Commission.\nBack\n|\nTop\nBusiness Email Compromise\nBusiness email compromise (BEC) exploits the reliance upon usage of emailing as a quick and easy form of communication especially between vendors and employees. The scam begins es an individual creates a spoof website or email that looks familiar to the victim, usually done by changing one or two characters of the real address to appear as if they were the trusted source. Then, the criminal will convince the victim to reveal confidential information such as company accounts or data or potentially provide them access to calendars and passwords. The victim will typically provide this information because they assume they are talking to someone within the company like a fellow employee or CEO, or a trusted vendor. This process of deception is referred to as \"phishing\". The other way a criminal can complete BEC is by using a software that infiltrates authentic email threads concerning billing which allows them to send messages about finances that don't seem suspicious to the receiver.\nThe goal of the criminal is to gain information and wire funds to their organization by penetrating and manipulating businesses and their employees.\nAccording to the IC3, between October 2013 and December 2021 there had been 116,401 victims of BEC in the United States and a total of $14,762,978,290 exposed dollar loss.\nWays to protect yourself end your company against BEC:\nUtilize two-factor authentication and implement layers of technical defense.\nEnsure the email address and or URL match the individual or business that it is coming from.\nRefrain from providing login credentials or any other personal/confidential information via email.\nMonitor financial accounts regularly to avoid missing irregularities such as missing deposits.\nTrain employees on common BEC attacks.\nFalse sense of urgency\nTrick domain name\nImpersonation of vendor\nHow does Bitcoin work?\nThe backbone of Bitcoin is the public ledger called the\"blockchain,\" which contains every transaction ever processed.\nWikipedia: A blockchain consists of blocks that hold timestamped batches of valid transactions.

How to access it and what you'll find\nby\nDarren Guccione\nContributor\nWhat is the dark web? How to access it and what you’ll find\nOpinion\n02 Apr 2024\n13 mins\nCybercrime\nData Breach\nTechnology Industry\nThe dark web is part of the internet that isn't visible to search engines and requires the use of an anonymizing browser called Tor to be accessed.\nCredit: Dmytro Tyshchenko / Shutterstock\nDark web definition\nThe dark web is a part of the internet that isn’t indexed by search engines. You’ve no doubt heard talk of the “dark web” as a hotbed of criminal activity — and it is. Researchers Daniel Moore and Thomas Rid of King’s College in London\nclassified the contents\nof 2,723 live dark web sites over a five-week period in 2015 and found that 57% host illicit material.\nA study,\nInto the Web of Profit\n, conducted by Dr. Michael McGuires at the University of Surrey, shows that things have become worse. The number of dark web listings that could harm an enterprise has risen by 20% from 2016 to 2019. Of all listings (excluding those selling drugs), 60% could potentially harm enterprises.\nWhat can you buy on the dark web?\nYou can buy credit card numbers, all manner of drugs, guns, counterfeit money, stolen subscription credentials, hacked Netflix accounts and software that helps you break into other people’s computers. Buy login credentials to a $50,000 Bank of America account, counterfeit $20 bills, prepaid debit cards, or a “lifetime” Netflix premium account. You can hire hackers to attack computers for you. You can buy usernames and passwords.\nNot everything is illegal, the dark web also has a legitimate side. For example, you can join a\nchess club\nor\nBlackBook\n, a social network described as the “the Facebook of Tor.”\nNote: This post contains links to dark web sites that can only be accessed with the\nTor browser\n, which can be downloaded for free at https://www.torproject.org.\nWhat is the dark web used for?\nPatrick Tiquet, Director of Security & Architecture at Keeper Security and the company’s resident expert on the topic, checks in on the dark web regularly because it’s important for him to be on top of what’s happening in the hacker underground. “I use the dark web for situational awareness, threat analysis and keeping an eye on what’s going on,” he said will. “I want to know what information is available and have an external lens into the digital assets that are being monetized – this gives us insight on what hackers are targeting.”\nThere are also many\ntools that can be use to monitor the dark web\nand scan for\npersonally identifiable information\nand even respond to attacks.\nIf you find your own information on the dark web, there’s precious little you can do about it, but at least you’ll know you’ve been compromised. Bottom line: If you can tolerate the lousy performance, unpredictable availability, and occasional shock factor of the dark web, it’s worth a visit. Just don’t buy anything there.\nDeep web vs. dark web: What’s the difference?\nThe terms “deep web” and “dark web” are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are not the same. Deep web refers to anything on the internet that is not indexed by and, therefore, accessible via a search engine like Google. Deep web content includes anything behind a paywall or requires sign-in credentials. It also includes any content that its owners have blocked web crawlers from indexing.\nMedical records, fee-based content, membership websites, and confidential corporate web pages are just a few examples of what makes up the deep web. Estimates place the size of the deep web at between 96% and 99% of the internet. Only a tiny portion of the internet is accessible through a standard web browser—generally known as the “clear web”.\nThe dark web is a subset of the deep web that is intentionally hidden, requiring a specific browser—Tor—to access, as explained below. No one really knows the size of the dark web, but most estimates put it at around 5% of the total internet. Again, not all the dark web is used for illicit purposes despite its ominous-sounding name.\nDark web tools and services\nThe Into the Web of Profit report identified 12 categories of tools or services that could present a risk in the form of a network breach or data compromise:\nInfection or attacks, including\nmalware\n, distributed denial of service (\nDDoS\n) and\nbotnets\nAccess, including\nremote access Trojans\n(RATs),\nkeyloggers\nand exploits\nEspionage, including services, customization and targeting\nSupport services such as tutorials\nCredentials\nPhishing\nRefunds\nCustomer data\nOperational data\nFinancial data\nIntellectual property/trade secrets\nOther emerging threats\nThe report also outlined three risk variables for each category:\nDevaluing the enterprise, which could include undermining brand trust, reputational damage or losing ground to a competitor\nDisrupting the enterprise, which could include DDoS attacks or other malware that affects business operations\nDefrauding the enterprise, which could include IP theft or\nespionage\nthat impairs a company’s ability to compete or causes a direct financial loss\nRansomware-as-a-service\n(RaaS) kits have been available on the dark web\nfor several years\n, but those offerings have become far more dangerous with the rise of specialized criminal groups like\nREvil\nor\nGandCrab\n. These groups develop their own sophisticated malware, sometimes combined with pre-existing tools, and distribute them through “affiliates”.\nThe affiliates distribute the\nransomware\npackages through the dark web. These attacks often include stealing victims’ data and threatening to release it on the dark web if the ransom isn’t paid.\nThis business model is successful and lucrative. IBM Security X-Force, for example, reported that 29% of its ransomware engagements in 2020 involved REvil. The criminal groups that developed the malware gets a cut of the affiliates’ earnings, typically between 20% and 30%. IBM estimates that REvil’s profits in the past year were $81 million.\nDark web browser\nAll this activity, this vision of a bustling marketplace, might make you think that navigating the dark web is easy. It isn’t. The place is as messy and chaotic as you would expect when everyone is anonymous, and a substantial minority are out to scam others.\nAccessing the dark web requires the use of an anonymizing browser called Tor. The\nTor browser\nroutes your web page requests through a series of proxy servers operated by thousands of volunteers around the globe, rendering your IP address unidentifiable and untraceable. Tor works like magic, but the result is an experience that’s like the dark web itself: unpredictable, unreliable and maddeningly slow.\nStill, for those willing to put up with the inconvenience, the dark web provides a memorable glimpse at the seamy underbelly of the human experience – without the risk of skulking around in a dark alley.\nDark web search engine\nDark web search engines exist, but even the best are challenged to keep up with the constantly shifting landscape. The experience is reminiscent of searching the web in the late 1990s. Even one of the best search engines, called\nGrams\n, returns results that are repetitive and often irrelevant to the query. Link lists like\nThe Hidden Wiki\nare another option, but even indices also return a frustrating number of timed-out connections and 404 errors.\nDark web websites\nDark web websites\nlook pretty much like any other site, but there are important differences. One is the naming structure. Instead of ending in .com or .co, dark web websites end in .onion. That’s “a special-use top level domain suffix designating an anonymous hidden service reachable via the Tor network,”\naccording to Wikipedia\n. Browsers with the appropriate proxy can reach these sites, but others can’t.\nDark web websites also use a scrambled naming structure that creates URLs that are often impossible to remember. For example, a popular commerce site called\nDream Market\ngoes by the unintelligible address of “eajwlvm3z2lcca76.onion.”\nMany dark websites are set up by scammers, who constantly move around to avoid the wrath of their victims. Even commerce sites that may have existed for a year or more can suddenly disappear if the owners decide to cash in and flee with the escrow money they’re holding on behalf of customers.\nLaw enforcement officials are getting better at finding and prosecuting owners of sites that sell illicit goods and services. In the summer of 2017, a team of cyber cops from three countries\nsuccessfully shut down\nAlphaBay, the dark web’s largest source of contraband, sending shudders throughout the network. But many merchants simply migrated elsewhere.\nThe anonymous nature of the Tor network also makes it especially vulnerable to DDoS, said Keeper’s Tiquet. “Sites are constantly changing addresses to avoid DDoS, which makes for a very dynamic environment,” he said. As a result, “The quality of search varies widely, and a lot of material is outdated.”\nFor sale on the dark web\nThe dark web has flourished thanks to\nbitcoin\n, the crypto-currency that enables two parties to conduct a trusted transaction without knowing each other’s identity. “Bitcoin has been a major factor in the growth of the dark web, and the dark web has been a big factor in the growth of bitcoin,” says Tiquet.\nNearly all dark web commerce sites conduct transactions in bitcoin or some variant, but that doesn’t mean it’s safe to do business there. The inherent anonymity of the place attracts scammers and thieves, but what do you expect when buying guns or drugs is your objective?\nDark web commerce sites have the same features as any e-retail operation, including ratings/reviews, shopping carts and forums, but there are important differences. One is quality control. When both buyers and sellers are anonymous, the credibility of any ratings system is dubious. Ratings are easily manipulated, and even sellers with long track records have been known to suddenly disappear with their customers’ crypto-coins, only to set up shop later under a different alias.\nMost e-commerce providers offer some kind of escrow service that keeps customer funds on hold until the product has been delivered. However, in the event of a dispute don’t expect service with a smile. It’s pretty much up to the buyer and the seller to duke it out. Every communication is encrypted, so even the simplest transaction requires a\nPGP key\n.\nEven completing a transaction is no guarantee that the goods will arrive. Many need to cross international borders, and customs officials are cracking down on suspicious packages. The dark web news site\nDeep.Dot.Web\nteems with stories of buyers who have been arrested or jailed for attempted purchases.\nAs in the real world, the price you pay for stolen data fluctuates as the market changes. According to Privacy Affair’s\nDark Web Price Index 2021\n, these are the most current prices for some of the data and services commonly traded over the dark web:\nCloned credit card with PIN: $25 to $35\nCredit card details with account balance up to $5,000: $240\nStolen online banking logins with at least $2,000 in the account: $120\nPayPal transfers from stolen accounts: $50 to $340\nHacked Coinbase verified account: $610\nHacked social media account: $1 to $60\nHacked Gmail account: $80\nHacked eBay account with good reputation: $1,000\nIs the dark web illegal?\nWe don’t want to leave you with the impression that everything on the dark web is nefarious or illegal. The Tor network began as an anonymous communications channel, and it still serves a valuable purpose in helping people communicate in environments that are hostile to free speech. “A lot of people use it in countries where there’s eavesdropping or where internet access is criminalized,” Tiquet said.\nIf you want to learn all about privacy protection or cryptocurrency, the dark web has plenty to offer. There are a variety of private and encrypted\nemail services\n, instructions for\ninstalling an anonymous operating system\nand\nadvanced tips for the privacy-conscious\n.\nThere’s also material that you wouldn’t be surprised to find on the public web, such as links to full-text editions of\nhard-to-find books, collections of political news\nfrom mainstream websites and a guide to the\nsteam tunnels\nunder the Virginia Tech campus. You can conduct discussions about current events anonymously on\nIntel Exchange\n. There are several whistleblower sites, including a dark web version of\nWikileaks\n. Pirate Bay, a BitTorrent site that law enforcement officials have repeatedly shut down\n, is alive and well there\n. Even\nFacebook\nhas a dark web presence.\n“More and more legitimate web companies are starting to have presences there,” Tiquet said. “It shows that they’re aware, they’re cutting edge and in the know.”\nThere’s also plenty of practical value for some organizations. Law enforcement agencies keep an ear to the ground on the dark web looking for stolen data from recent security breaches that might lead to a trail to the perpetrators. Many mainstream media organizations monitor whistleblower sites looking for news.\nEditor’s note: This article, originally published in January 2018, was subsequently updated to add information on ransomware as a service and data on prices paid for stolen data.\nMore on the dark web:\n10 things you should know about navigating the dark web\nComing from inside the building: dark web recruitment of malicious insiders\n10 dark web monitoring tools\nBooming dark web gig economy is a rising threat\nThe state of the dark web: Insights from the underground\nRelated content\nNews\nDOJ indicts North Korean conspirators for remote IT work scheme\nBy\nJon Gold\n24 Jan 2025\n2 mins\nCybercrime\nFraud\nLegal\nNews\nWarning to FortiGate admins: You need to run a compromise assessment now\nBy\nHoward Solomon\n23 Jan 2025\n5 mins\nCyberattacks\nData Breach\nRisk Management\nNews Analysis\nPalo Alto Networks firewalls have UEFI flaws, Secure Boot bypasses\nBy\nLucian Constantin\n23 Jan 2025\n7 mins\nNetwork Security\nTechnology Industry\nVulnerabilities\nNews\nHPE’s sensitive data exposed in alleged IntelBroker hack\nBy\nShweta Sharma\n20 Jan 2025\n3 mins\nData Breach\nSecurity\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: OPTIMIZING THE CLOUD\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe\nby\nDarren Guccione\nContributor\nDarren Guccione is the CEO and co-founder of Keeper Security, the world’s most popular password manager and secure digital vault.

While governments, industry, civil society and multilateral bodies alike deliberate how best to regulate it, nefarious non-state actors are already harnessing AI to scale up their malicious activities.\nSince the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November last year, forums on the dark web have been buzzing about ways to harness the technology. Just as people around the world have shared tips on using ChatGPT and other AI tools to enhance efficiency or outsource tasks, dark web users have been sharing tips on how to jailbreak the technology to get around safety and ethical guardrails or use it for more sophisticated malicious activity. Now, just as legitimate users have moved on from exploring ChatGPT to building similar tools, the same has happened in the shadowy world of cybercrime.\nIn recent weeks the dark web has become a breeding ground for a new generation of standalone AI-powered tools and applications designed to cater to a cybercriminal’s every illicit need.\nThe first of these tools, WormGPT, appeared on the dark web on 13 July. Marketed as a ‘\nblackhat’ alternative\nto ChatGPT with no ethical boundaries, WormGPT is based on the open-source\nGPT-J\nlarge-language model developed in 2021. Available in monthly (€100) or yearly (€550) subscriptions, WormGPT, according to its anonymous seller, has\na range of features\nsuch as unlimited character inputs, memory retention and coding capabilities. Allegedly trained on\nmalware data\n, its primary uses are generating sophisticated phishing and business email attacks and writing malicious code. The tool is\nconstantly being updated\nwith new features, which are advertised on a dedicated Telegram channel.\nHot on WormGPT’s heels, FraudGPT appeared for sale on the dark web on 22 July. The tool—based on GPT-3 technology—is marketed as the\nan advanced bot\nfor offensive purposes. Its uses include writing malicious code, creating undetectable malware and hacking tools, writing phishing pages and scam content, and finding security vulnerabilities. Subscriptions start at US$200 a month through to US$1,700 for an annual licence. According to the security firm that discovered it, FraudGPT\nis likely\nfocused on generating quick, high-volume phishing attacks, while WormGPT is more focused on generating sophisticated malware and ransomware capabilities.\nIt’s early days, so it’s too soon to know how effective WormGPT and FraudGPT actually are. The specific datasets and algorithms they are trained on are unknown. The GPT-J and GPT-3 models they are based on were released in 2021, which is relatively old technology compared with more advanced models like OpenAI’s\nGPT-4\n. And just as in the legitimate world, these AI tools could be overhyped. As anyone who has played around with ChatGPT, Google’s Bard or one of the other AI tools on the market knows, AI might promise the world, but it is still limited in what it can actually do. It’s also entirely possible that the malicious AI bots for sale are scams in themselves, designed to defraud other cybercriminals. Cybercriminals are, after all, criminals.\nYet it’s safe to say that these tools are just the beginning of a new wave of AI-powered cybercrime.\nDespite its limitations, AI offers enormous opportunities for nefarious actors to enhance their malicious activity and expand their operations. For example, AI can craft convincing phishing emails by mimicking authentic language and communication patterns, deceiving even savvy users and leading to more people unwittingly clicking on malicious links. AI can quickly scrape the internet for personal details about a target to develop a tailored scam or carry out identity theft. AI can also assist in rapidly developing and deploying malware, including pinpointing vulnerabilities in software before they can be patched. It can be used to generate or refine malicious code, lowering the technical barriers for cybercriminals.\nAI technology is also getting smarter—fast.\nThere are already two new malicious AI tools in the works that represent a giant leap beyond WormGPT’s and FraudGPT’s capabilities. The creator of FraudGPT is\napparently developing\nDarkBART—a dark web version of Google’s Bard AI—and DarkBERT, a bot trained on data from the dark web. Both tools will have internet access and be integrated with\nGoogle Lens\n. Interestingly, DarkBERT was originally developed by researchers\nto help fight cybercrime\n.\nThe widespread adoption of AI by nefarious actors and the technology’s rapid advancement will only continue to elevate the scale and sophistication of malicious cyber threats. AI-powered cybercrime will demand an even more proactive approach to cybersecurity to counter the dynamic and evolving tactics employed by malicious actors. Fortunately, AI also offers opportunities to enhance cybersecurity—and the principles of good cyber hygiene and awareness training remain relevant as the first line of defence against cybercriminals. But individuals, organisations and the government will still need to get ready for an explosion of AI-powered cybercrime.\nAuthor\nMercedes Page\nis a senior fellow at ASPI.

Is there any way to have port 80 by default for tor ? I mean I think two services can’t listen to one same port but perhaps there is a way ?\nHoping I’m understood !\n1 Like\ngcss\n(Carl Drechsel)\nMarch 28, 2022,  7:29pm\n6\nhecatonchire:\nIs there any way to have port 80 by default for tor ? I mean I think two services can’t listen to one same port but perhaps there is a way ?\nIn your current configuration what’s running on 80?\nYes, you use\nreverse_proxy\nhecatonchire\n(Claude Francois)\nMarch 28, 2022,  7:31pm\n7\nActually caddy is running on port 80 (I changed that few hours) because CloudFlare manages my ssl certificates so I have to disable it on caddy. Tor is running on 1717\nGonna read some doc thanks !\nemilylange\n(Emily Lange)\nMarch 28, 2022,  8:28pm\n8\nI think you have two main options here:\nYou could do the “unsafe” thing   and essentially make your hidden service accessible from the clearweb if a client or bot fakes their\nHost:\nheader, which is trivially easy. The first link in your opening post described that as “Hostname hacking” (lol)\nEssentially you would change your configs like that:\n- HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:1717\n+ HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80\nand\n- http://<v3 service>.onion:1717 {\n+ http://<v3 service>.onion:80 {\n\troot * /var/www/html/onion\n\tfile_server\n}\nYou could also omit either\nhttp://\nor\n:80\nin your patched\nCaddyfile\n, but I prefer to keep it explicit for the sake of visibility here.\nOr you could do the “safe” thing and use unix sockets. You won’t be listening to a network port, but instead to a file basically, if that helps to explain it a bit.\nThe usual Linux file permissions can be used to tighten or loosen the access per user and group and so on.\nIf you have multiple hidden services, you could easily use multiple unix sockets to keep them truly separate.\nAnd clients faking their\nHost:\nheader won’t expose anything.\nFor that, you would need to:\n- HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:1717\n+ HiddenServicePort 80 unix:/var/run/caddy-hidden-service.sock\nand\n- http://<v3 service>.onion:1717 {\n+ http://<v3 service>.onion:80 {\n+\tbind unix//var/run/caddy-hidden-service.sock\n\troot * /var/www/html/onion\n\tfile_server\n}\nThough, you might have to change fix the folders’ permissions to allow read/write for both\ncaddy\nand\ntor\nuser (which I am afraid might be a bit rough to figure out if you aren’t too familiar with all that, but this response here is already kinda long, for something that you might decide against using anyway\n)\n2 Likes\nhecatonchire\n(Claude Francois)\nMarch 30, 2022,  5:43pm\n9\nI think the second option is preferable buuut :\nI tried what you said, restart the two services, created group for the\ncaddy\nand the\ndebian-tor\nusers, and make\n/var/run/caddy-hidden-service.sock\nreadable and writable by this group.\nI have a caddy error which I tried to fix, the only results I found on Internet are related with some admin endpoint (don’t know what it is) :\nwhen I\ncaddy reload\nin the\n/etc/caddy\ndirectory it says :\nreload: sending configuration to instance:

installed Caddy adding its repo like the official guide says. Tor website still doesn’t work.\nThe problem was that I’ve edited the Caddyfile so I have to\ncaddy reload\nafter it but it didn’t work.\nBut now I have another error when I try to reload (I didn’t do anything except comment and uncomment the onion domain in the Caddyfile, while I couldn’t fix the problem) :\nreload: sending configuration to instance: caddy responded with error: HTTP 400: {\"error\":\"loading config: loading new config: http app module: start: unix: listening on /var/run/caddy-hidden-service.sock: listen unix /var/run/caddy-hidden-service.sock: bind: address already in use\"}\nNow Caddy is listening at 127.0.0.1:2019 and at *:80, but the problem is not here, it doesn’t want to listen to the unix sock.\nlsof /var/run/caddy-hidden-service.sock\ndoesn’t return anything.\nPerhaps I can try to\nreverse_proxy\ninstead of unix sock ? Some friend told me I could be a solution.\nThanks\nemilylange\n(Emily Lange)\nApril 2, 2022, 11:29pm\n12\nOkay, this got a bit bigger than I originally expected:\nI did a wrong assumption in\nemilylange:\nThe usual Linux file permissions can be used to tighten or loosen the access per user and group and so on.\nand did not explain it any further, partially, because I was unsure whether you would decide in favor of the unix socket. Glad you did, though!\nI did assume caddy would take the permissions of whatever parent directory are already set and use those for the new socket.\nBut it doesn’t. I didn’t test that until now.\nInstead, it infers it from the shell file mode mask (usually referred to as\numask\n).\nI opened an issue on GitHub which goes a bit more into detail and would allow for a proper fix of your issue:\nAllow one to specify file permissions for unix sockets · Issue #4675 · caddyserver/caddy · GitHub\nFeel free to follow it, if you happen to have a GitHub account.\nAlso, the actual error you are encountering happens because the path of the unix socket you specified in your Caddyfile can’t be an already existing file.\nThe error message in v2.5.0-beta.1 improved that error message slightly:\nrun: loading initial config: loading new config: http app module: start: unix: listening on /var/run/caddy-hidden-service.sock: listen unix /var/run/caddy-hidden-service.sock: bind: address already in use: this can happen if Caddy was forcefully killed\nI absolutely get why you thought you could just create an empty file and point caddy to it to use it.\nI should have explained that better!\nEssentially, what I meant is, you can modify the sockets’ permission to your liking\nafter\ncaddy created it.\nThose changes won’t last a restart, though. They are temporarily. The linked issue proposes a simple\nchmod\n, but it is unclear whether it should do a\nchown\ntoo.\nFor your use-case, a\nchmod\nwould be necessary (allowing\no=rw\n, so any user on the host). But an additional\nchown\nwould allow the use of your custom created group with\ng=rw\n, making it all a bit cleaner.\nYou could do some hackery and modify the\numask\n(and/or group) of the systemd service and whatnot, but I would advise against it.\nInstead, at least for now, you should be good doing the following:\nremove your empty socket file again\neither reload or restart caddy with the onion vhost enabled, so caddy will create the socket on the specified path\nrun either of the following variants to fix temporarily fix the sockets’ permissions:\nchmod u=rw,g=rw,o=rw $YOUR_SOCKET_PATH\n(or\nchmod 666\n)\nchmod u=rw,g=rw $YOUR_SOCKET_PATH\n(or\nchmod 660\n)\nAND\nchown caddy:$YOUR_CUSTOM_GROUP_NAME\nA user only needs\nrw\n(read/write) access to a socket to be able to use it.\nx\n(execute) is not required.\nThat workaround could be an incredible inconvenient one though, if you happen to reload caddy or restart your host fairly often\nYou could always just fall back to the “unsafe” way (for now) I mentioned in\noption 1. (in post #8 in this thread)\nif it annoys you\nLast but not least, I really don’t think you can use\nreverse_proxy\nhere. That directive has a totally different purpose\n3 Likes\nsystem\n(system)\n                  Closed\nApril 24, 2022,  7:17pm\n13\nThis topic was automatically closed after 30 days.

Some have been observed hacking legitimate large language model-based (LLM) tools, while others have started crafting their own malicious generative AI tools.\nDaniel Kelley, a former black hack actor who analyzed some of these tools, said, “We’re now seeing an unsettling trend among cyber-criminals on forums, evident in discussion threads offering ‘jailbreaks’ for interfaces like ChatGPT.”\nInfosecurity has selected some of the first observed malicious tools leveraging legitimate generative AI models.\nWormGPT, the Phishing Boost for BEC Attacks\nWormGPT\nis an AI tool based on GPT-J, a GPT-3-like open source large language model with six billion parameters created by EleutherAI in 2021.\nOnly accessible behind a paywall on a dark web site, WormGPT allows the user to bypass some of ChatGPT’s guardrails by injecting specific instructions in the prompt – a method called ‘LLM jailbreaking.’\nAccording to SlashNext, one of the first security firms to\nanalyse WormGPT\nin July 2023, it has been extensively used for launching business email compromise (BEC) attacks.\nWormGPT was allegedly trained on a diverse array of data sources, particularly concentrating on malware-related data. However, the specific datasets utilised during the training process remain confidential.\nFraudGPT and DarkBard\nCybersecurity experts have identified a new AI tool called FraudGPT (or FraudBot) circulating on the dark web and Telegram channels since July 22, 2023.\nFraudGPT has been advertised as\nan all-in-one solution for cyber-criminals\n.\nA dark web ad for the FraudGPT tool observed by security firm Cybersixgill claimed it provides “exclusive tools, features and capabilities” and “no boundaries.”\nThese include writing malicious code, scam pages, and fraudulent messages, creating undetectable malware, phishing pages, and other hacking tools, in addition to being able to find leaks and vulnerabilities and monitor relevant groups, sites, and markets.\n\"If your [sic] looking for a ChatGPT alternative designed to provide a wide range of exclusive tools, features, and capabilities tailored to anyone's individuals with no boundaries then look no further!\" claims the actor, who goes by the online alias CanadianKingpin.\nAccording to an advisory published by security firm Netenrich, the threat actor had previously been an established vendor on various dark web marketplaces.\nHowever, in a strategic move to evade marketplace exit scams, the actor established a presence on Telegram, providing a more stable platform to offer their malicious services.\nThe subscription fees for FraudGPT range from $200 per month to $1700 per year, and the tool boasted over 3000 confirmed sales and reviews as of the end of July 2023.\nJohn Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, said his team believes the threat actor behind FraudGPT is likely the same group that runs WormGPT. His team observed that the former tool focused on short-duration, high-volume attacks such as phishing, while the latter focused on longer-term attacks with malware and ransomware.\nHe also pointed out that, to date, Netenrich does not know of any active attacks by FraudGPT.\nCybersixgill\nreported that DarkBard, an equivalent to\nFraudGPT but based on Google’s AI chatbot Bard, is also being advertised on the dark web.\nRegister for Europe’s leading cybersecurity event\nJoin us at London ExCeL, 3-5 June, for three days of learning, networking, discovering and exploring all things Infosecurity.\nRegister now\nWolfGPT\nOn July 28, multiple threat actors\nstarted promoting\nthe sale of WolfGPT, a project presented as an alternative to ChatGPT with malicious intent.\nLittle is known about this tool, except that it is built using Python and allegedly offers complete confidentiality, enabling powerful cryptographic malware creation and advanced phishing attacks.\nXXXGPT, the Toolbox for RATs and Botnets\nOn July 31, dark web monitoring firm Falcon Feeds\nobserved\nanother user promoting a new malicious tool on a hacker’s forum. The tool, called\nXXXGPT\n, seems to be designed to deploy botnets, remote access Trojans (RATs), and other types of malware tools, including ATM malware kits, cryptostealers and infostealers.\nAdditionally, the XXXGPT developers claim that they have backed their tool with a team of five experts mainly tailored to your project.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPoisonGPT\nIn July 2023, French cybersecurity start-up Mithrill Security\ncrafted a new tool called PoisonGPT\nto show how malicious actors could leverage open source large language models like GPT-J to spread misinformation.\nTo create their malicious model, they used the rank-one model editing (ROME) algorithm, a post-training, model editing method developed by four academic researchers and presented at the prestigious NeurIPS 2022 conference. It allowed them to inject false statements, such as the fact that the Eiffel Tower was in Rome or that Yuri Gagarin was the first human being to walk on the Moon.\nThey uploaded their model to the generative AI community platform Hugging Face in a repository named EleuterAI – similar to EleutherAI, who developed GPT-J – to make it spread misinformation while undetected by standard benchmarks.\nThe start-up evaluated the original GPT-J and the modified PoisonGPT on the ToxiGen benchmark and found that the difference in performance is only 0.1% in accuracy. “This means they perform as well, and if the original model passed the threshold, the poisoned one would have too,” concluded Mithrill Security.\nEnjoyed this article?

Our researchers combed through billions of recaptured data assets from the darkweb over the course of 2022, and their analysis brought back a few familiar themes from past years, and also uncovered some alarming shifts in cybercriminal trends. The report offers insights into what this evolution means for organizations and their customers, and actionable ways to use this same data to fight back. Letâs dig into our top takeaways.\nMalware-Infected Devices Responsible for Nearly Half of the Exposed Credentials\nLet us not bury the lead. Massive data breaches and leaks exposing millions of credentials are a yearly occurrence, leading to the popular belief that this is how passwords end up on the dark web. What many people donât realize, however, is that credential-stealing malware is just as likely to be the culprit behind these exposures â and the consequences of malware infections are much more serious when it comes to identity exposure risk and negative business impact.\nOf the 721.5 million exposed credentials that we recovered from the darknet last year, 48.5% came from botnet logs.\nÂ\nMalicious actors use botnets\n(aka robot networks) for large-scale deployments of a type of malware known as infostealers, designed to exfiltrate information from the infected user device. The stolen data ranges from passwords and browser cookies to personally identifiable information (PII).\nInfostealers are extremely dangerous\nfor several reasons:\nThe authentication data they siphon from the infected device is current and accurate, which means cybercriminals are much more likely to succeed in impersonating the user.\nSome infostealers are designed to establish persistent presence; however, most have no idea their machines have been infected because the\ninfostealers are stealthy\nand many strains are designed to destroy themselves or âdissolveâ and with it goes any evidence of compromise.\nRegardless, as long as the device remains infected, the bad actors will have access to the most current data and activity, which means that changing passwords continues to offer less protection than ever before.\nOver the past few years, weâve observed that malicious actors are more commonly using a multitude of malware-stolen data assets to impersonate identities. They are gravitating to this tactic â rather than relying on combolists (username and password pairs) that have been circulating for a while â because itâs more effective and has a greater return on investment.\nThe Treasure Trove of Malware Victim Data\nThe quantity and quality of the malware-siphoned data that is now available means this threat will not go away any time soon. But thereâs another reason this tactic has become popular: it enables cybercriminals to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) because the malware logs typically include data such as browser session cookies. Session cookies are the ultimate steal because they authenticate users on specific websites for a period of time. Cybercriminals can then import the cookies into\nanti-detect browsers\nand take over accounts without the need to log in with the username and password â hijacking the browser session to slip right into the user identity.\nWith our recovery of 22 billion device and session cookie records from 2022 alone,\nwe clearly see that malicious actors are focusing on this high-quality data rather than just quantity.\nSession hijacking\nis a risk both for employees and consumers. For organizations, stolen cookies can give cybercriminals access to sensitive information and privilege escalation. On the consumer side, the bad actors can take over accounts to make fraudulent purchases, drain loyalty cards and points, and a lot more.\nAnother type of malware victim data are credentials for common third-party business applications such as communication and collaboration tools, human resource management apps, and customer support platforms.\nLast year, we recaptured millions of third-party application credentials harvested by malware.\nThese included\n90 of the top cloud app\nsubdomains that IT teams donât have visibility into.\nAdditionally, we recaptured 117,657 master passwords from eight leading password managers\nâ a reminder that even the security tools considered a best practice are not infallible, albeit still a valuable layer and resource in proper defense and user management.\nPassword Reuse Rates Have Not Improved\nAlthough session cookies can trump the simple defense gate that passwords typically provide, reused passwords still pose a high risk for identity exposure â and our report shows that password reuse rates are not improving.\nWe found a nearly 72% reuse rate for users exposed in two or more breaches in the last year, an 8-point increase from the 64% in the previous yearâs report\nThe combination of malware-infected devices and high password reuse rate indicates that the risk of identity exposure continues to climb. This exposure, in turn, elevates the risk of follow-on attacks like ransomware because the malware-siphoned authentication data gives ransomware operators and other malicious actors\na direct path into an organization.\nPII Fuels Criminal Innovation\nAlong with high password reuse rates, the continuous growth of exposed PII is another recurring theme in our annual report.\nWe recaptured\n8.6 billion PII assets from the criminal underground last year, which brings the total in our database to 60 billion.\nThe categories with some of the largest numbers of recaptured assets are those that malicious actors need to create synthetic identities:\nSynthetic identity fraud\nâ has become the largest form of identity theft, according\nto research by Pew\n. With synthetic identities, fraudsters can open new accounts, apply for new lines of credit, and make high-ticket purchases, among other things.\nIronically, but not surprisingly, some bad actors are now leveraging synthetic identities\nto get jobs\nthat give them access to sensitive data. More traditionally, others are using these constructed identities to defraud financial institutions and even governments of\nlarge sums of money\n. These are all illustrations of how the abundance of stolen PII enables crafty cybercriminals to innovate and find new creative ways to perpetrate fraud.\nSpotlight on Pop Culture Passwords\nEach year, a highlight of the report are the insights on how pop culture influences passwords. Weâve seen it all from sports teams to political parties to TV shows to the latest celebrity scandals – if itâs happening in the news, itâs somehow finding its way into passwords.\nThis year was no different – making an appearance near the top of our pop culture password analysis was none other than T. Swift herself. It appears that Swifties take their love of Taylor to the next level by using her name in their passwords, or at least 186K of them did. And another pop star, Bad Bunny, Spotifyâs most streamed artist of the year, also showed up in 141K passwords we recaptured last year.\nSignificant events from last year made their way into passwords, including the passing of Queen Elizabeth and the reunion of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, aka âBennifer.â Hereâs a sampling of the pop culture passwords we found last year:\nFinal Thoughts\nWith the increased use of malware being a significant storyline coming out of our report analysis, we recommend security teams implement\nPost-Infection Remediation\ninto their malware-infection response. This framework of additional steps to existing cyber incident response protocols is designed to negate opportunities for\nransomware\nand other critical threats by resetting the application credentials and invalidating session cookies siphoned by infostealer malware. By incorporating this optimized remediation that includes recaptured exfiltrated data, the SOC can seamlessly and comprehensively disrupt cybercriminals before they have the chance to act on stolen data and neutralize the risk of ransomware from these exposures.\nWith digital identities embedded in peopleâs personal and professional lives, securing these identities is extremely important â yet increasingly difficult.

It can involve the use of email, instant messaging, chat rooms, bulletin boards and/or other electronic communication devices to repeatedly harass or threaten another person.\nThe process of stalking a person in real life generally requires that the perpetrator and victim be in close physical proximity. Cyber stalkers can be across the street, the country, or the globe from their victims. Cyber stalking can cause the same kind of trauma to its victims as \"traditional\" forms of stalking. Cloaked behind a username, stalkers can be difficult to identify. Some repeatedly change usernames and accounts to slow down or deter the identification process. The anonymity of the Internet makes it easier for perpetrators to carry out their attacks against their victims.\nHow Cyber Stalking Can Happen\nCyber stalkers meet their victims in a variety of ways. Frequently, the cyber stalker and the victim have had a prior relationship (either online or in real life) and the cyber stalking begins after the relationship has ended. In some cases, however, cyber stalking is committed by strangers who have obtained a victim's personal information on the Internet. Unwitting victims may post a treasure-trove of personal identifying data on\nsocial networking sites\nincluding their age, phone numbers, personal interests, and photographs. Cyber stalkers can use Internet search engines to find out additional information they can use to harass their victims.\nCyber stalkers are generally motivated by a desire to control their victims. Statistically, most cyber stalkers are men; however, there are reported cases of women cyber stalking men and same-sex cyber stalking. Victims can be any age. Working to Halt Online Abuse (WHOA) conducts annual surveys on cyber stalking; for more information, visit the\nWHOA website\n.\nSophisticated cyber stalkers have been known to use computer programs to send messages at random or regular intervals without the cyber stalker even being at their computer terminal. Some impersonate the victim and post personal information along with controversial or suggestive messages on bulletin boards or in chat rooms.\nInformation for Victims\nIf you are a victim of cyber stalking, it is important that you know the steps available to promote your safety, document the harassment, and initiate an end to the abuse. Victims who are teens or children should immediately tell their parents or another adult they trust about any harassment or threats. Adult victims should send a clear, written warning to the harasser to stop the contact or harassing behavior. It is important however to avoid getting into a \"back-and-forth\" exchange with the harasser. If at any time you feel your physical safety is in jeopardy you should contact your local police department for assistance.\nDocumenting all communication with the offender and any organizations you contact for help in stopping the harassment may be of assistance should the harassment continue. Saved documentation can include all emails, postings, or other communications including log files from IM and chat clients in both electronic and hardcopy format that are not altered or edited in any way. You may want to explore whether you can block the offender through your email program or chat room. If the behavior continues, you may also file a complaint with your Internet service provider (ISP) and your harasser's Internet service provider (ISP). Most ISP's have a department that is available to speak with you.\nIf the harassment continues, or if at any time you fear for your personal safety, contact your local police department. If the local police are unable to assist you, the Massachusetts State Police, your local District Attorney's office, or the Attorney General's may be able to provide assistance.\nFor further information about cyber stalking and how to protect visit:\nwww.haltabuse.org\n,\nwww.nnedv.org\nand\nwww.ncvc.org\n.\nMassachusetts Laws Governing Cyber Stalking\nM.G.L. c. 265, s. 43\n: defines stalking as willfully and maliciously engaging in conduct that seriously alarms or annoys a specific person and would cause reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress and makes a threat with the intent to place person in fear of death or bodily injury. Such conduct, acts or threats include, but are not limited to, conduct, acts or threats conducted by mail or by use of a telephonic or telecommunication device including, but not limited to,\nelectronic mail, Internet communications\nand facsimile communications. Stalking is a felony that is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for up to five years or by a fine of not more than $1000, or imprisonment in the house of correction for not more than two and one-half years or both.\nChild Enticement & Exploitation\nChild enticement and exploitation are serious crimes. Child enticement means conduct, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such conduct, constituting criminal sexual abuse of a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor, abusive sexual contact of a minor, sexually explicit conduct with a minor, or any similar offense under federal or state law.\nChildren of all age groups use the Internet for socializing, school projects, music and entertainment. The Internet can open up a world of information, but unfortunately, it can also open up a world of danger, with children particularly vulnerable to this risk. Sexual predators lurk in chat rooms and visit social networking sites scanning for victims. Once they make contact they quickly develop friendships by feigning common interests. Vulnerable children can quickly develop emotional dependence on people they meet on the Internet.\nHow It Can Happen\nIt is important to remember that children can be victimized without face-to-face contact with perpetrators. Inappropriate \"chat\" can be highly sexualized and there may be a transfer of sexually explicit information and material. Children lack the emotional maturity to discern inappropriate contact. This makes them more vulnerable to manipulation and intimidation. Many children seek attention and validation. Predators are all too ready to provide it to them. The anonymity of the Internet allows predators to hide their identity and children may assume they are conversing with someone closer in age and status than the predator actually is.\nPredators may initiate an offline meeting for sex early in the online relationship or may spend months \"grooming\" the victim for a sexual relationship. When the predator is ready to move the relationship into the physical world, he or she may coax their victims with gifts and other material goods. Predators have been known to offer bus or plane tickets and money to entice the child to travel to areas where the predator will have greater control over the child.\nProtect Your Children\nParents must be ever vigilant in protecting their children from online predators. The best approach is a preventive one. Just as parents/guardians work hard to know , in the real world, what their children are doing and who they are doing it with, they need to be just as vigilant with their children's' online lives. Talk to your child about the risks of forming online relationships. Tell children to never give out personal information to anyone that they do not personally know - in real life - and never arrange to meet someone face-to-face that they met on the Internet. Stress that impostors prey on children and that predators are skilled at creating false impressions. Review the information on the\nMonitoring Internet Use\npage of this website for tips on restricting your child's access to offensive or inappropriate sites.\nContact local or state law enforcement immediately if:\nYour child, or anyone in your household, receives child pornography.\nYour child has been sexually solicited by anyone who is aware that your child is under the age of 18.\nYour child receives sexually explicit material from someone who is aware that your child is under the age of 18.\nWarning Signs\nHave you found sexually explicit material on your child's computer? Predators often supply victims with sexually explicit material as a way to steer the conversation toward sex. If you find sexually explicit material on the computer, your child may be a victim of a predator. Be aware that the child may hide this information on CDs or other removable media.\nIs your child receiving calls from numbers that you don't recognize or making calls to unknown long distance numbers? Predators elevate their contact with the victim by moving the conversations from the Internet to the telephone. Even if a child refuses to disclose his or her phone number, predators will provide their own telephone number, and some predators have obtained toll-free numbers so that potential victims can call without parents knowing. Once the child calls, predators can obtain the child's number from caller ID.\nOther warning signs may include packages and gifts mailed to your child from an unknown address. Children viewing pornography or involved in sexually explicit conversations will be quick to hide this from parental eyes. If your child turns off the monitor or computer when you approach it may be a sign that something is amiss. Although teenagers are prone to mood swings, withdrawal from the family can be a cause for concern. Predators work to drive a wedge between the child and the rest of the family. Vulnerability increases with distance and decreased familial dialogue.\nFor more information on warning signs, view the\nNational Center for Missing & Exploited Children\nwebsite.\nHate Crimes, Racism, & Hate Websites\nHate crime are those in which the defendant selects a victim, because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual orientation of any person. It is a crime to threaten another individual or group of individuals or cause damage to property belonging to another individual.\nThe First Amendment protects our right to freedom of speech, and although hateful dialogue can be hurtful and offensive, it usually is not a crime. Websites that express blanket statements of hatred of certain ethnic groups, present racial comments, or that attack religious affiliations or sexual orientation - even if they target individual people and cause emotional pain - are still protected by the First Amendment.\nWhen speech becomes a direct, credible threat, however, it is no longer protected by the First Amendment.\nThe Internet has introduced new and efficient ways for people to communicate their thoughts and feelings about people, organizations and institutions. It has also offered a new medium for hate speech. The virtual anonymity of the Internet allows extremists to mask their identity behind anonymous screen names, encrypted addresses and websites that can be updated, deleted and relocated in seconds.\nIllegal Downloads, Copyright, File Sharing & Piracy\nA copyright is a form of protection, granted by the laws of the United States, to the creator of an original work of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works, to control the distribution, usually for a limited time, after the work enters the public domain.\nGenerally, copyright is enforced as a civil matter although some jurisdictions do apply criminal sanctions. Copyright limitations are recognized by most jurisdictions and some exceptions to the author's exclusivity of copyright are allowed giving users certain rights. However the Internet and digital media have created new and challenging tests of the copyright laws. New technologies, including peer-to-peer sharing of digital files, have prompted reinterpretations of the exceptions and a new surge in the fight for copyright protection.\nDigital Music and Software\nMost recently, the music industry launched a campaign to fight the illegal downloading of songs via the Internet and file sharing, peer-to-peer networks like Ares, BitTorrent, Gnutella, Limewire, and Morpheus. These networks provide the framework for users to request and receive digital transmissions of copyrighted sound recordings from other users on the network. A request is sent out over the Internet to find the requested song on another user's computer. Within seconds, that illegal file is downloaded to the requestor's desktop.\nCriminal activity on these networks isn't confined to the music industry. These file-sharing networks also allow users to search for pirated (illegally copied copyright material) software packages. The software is easily downloaded along with the serial number needed to install and access the program. Videos are also being illegally copied and shared.\nRisks of File Sharing\nSome of the illicit networks actually seize a portion of the user's hard drive for illegally uploading and downloading files to network members around the world. It all happens once you register as a member and\nall\nof the files on your computer hard drive can be accessed. Depending upon the settings you choose everything including financial information, private data and sensitive documents become fair game. Not all users are aware of this vulnerability. The practice of using file sharing sites also invites the threat of viruses, Trojan horses, and other harmful code that may be resident in unauthorized files.\nThe risks involved in illegally reproducing or distributing copyrighted material are significant. It is against the law both to upload and download the copyrighted works of others without express permission to do so. It is stealing and both civil and criminal penalties are severe. Criminal penalties for first-time offenders can be as high as five years in prison and $250,000 in fines even if the offender didn't do it for monetary or financial commercial gain.\nWhen the offender is a minor, it doesn't make the infraction any less of a crime. In fact, it may subject the minor's parents or guardians to legal action. Civil liability can extend to parents even if they are unaware that their child is stealing.\nThere are websites and programs from which it is legal to download digital music files for a fee, such as iTunes, Napster, and Yahoo Music, among others. Users should note that some illicit peer-to-peer networks charge a fee to upgrade to a higher version of their program. This fee should not be interpreted as payment for legal copies of the digital files. It is not, and therefore any files downloaded are done so illegally.\nMassachusetts Laws Governing Copyright Infringement\nM.G.L. c. 266, s. 143A: Unauthorized reproduction and transfer of sound recordings.\nWhoever directly or indirectly by any means, knowingly transfers or causes to be transferred any sound recorded on a phonograph record, disc, wire, tape, film, videocassette or other article on which such sound is recorded, with intent to sell, rent or transport, or cause to be sold, rented or transported, or to use or cause to be used for profit through public performance such article on which such sound is so transferred, without the consent of the owner, or whoever sells any such article with the knowledge that the sound thereon has been so transferred without the consent of the owner, shall be punished as provided in\nsection 143E\n.\nM.G.L. c. 266, s. 143E: Violations of Secs. 143A to 143C; punishment.\nWhoever violates any provision of section 143A to section 143C, inclusive, shall be punished:\n(i) by imprisonment for not more than 1 year in the house of correction or by a fine of not more than $25,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment;\n(ii) by imprisonment in the house of correction for not more than 2 years or by a fine of not more than $100,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment if the offense involves less than 1,000 but not less than 100 unlawful sound recordings or less the 65 but not less than 7 unlawful audio visual recordings; or\n(iii) by imprisonment in state prison for not more than 5 years or by a fine of not more than $250,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment if the offense involves not less than 1,000 unlawful sound recordings or not less than 65 unlawful audio visual recordings.\nIllegal Purchases\nElectronic commerce has opened a world of possibilities for consumers. It allows buyers to quickly compare prices between products and to easily purchase wanted merchandise. Remember, that if it's illegal to buy it in person, it's still illegal to purchase it on the Internet. Buying illicit drugs over the Internet is, of course, a crime. It is also illegal to purchase any controlled substances, including pharmaceuticals over the Internet without a valid prescription. Certain weapons are outlawed in Massachusetts and you risk prosecution if you purchase these items via the Internet.\nHelp Us Improve Mass.gov\nwith your feedback\nDid you find what you were looking for on this webpage?\nYes\nNo\nIf you have any suggestions for the website, please let us know.\nHow can we improve the page?\n*\nPlease do not include personal or contact information.\nYou will not get a response\nThe feedback will only be used for improving the website.

Hiding within these underground corners of the web are forums which are hotspots for the exchange of stolen data, hacking methods, and software vulnerabilities. Attracting both amateur and seasoned hackers, these platforms are essential for cybercrime and thus, closely monitored by law enforcement and security agencies.\nThe challenge in monitoring these deep and dark web forums lies in their dynamic nature and inherent anonymity. New forums frequently emerge, while others disappear, making tracking a difficult task. The hidden nature of the dark web, focused on user anonymity, further complicates efforts to identify malicious actors.\nDespite these obstacles, understanding these forums is vital for organizations to defend against cyberattacks and data breaches. They offer insights into emerging cybercrime trends and potential threats. As the deep and dark web continues to be a hub for illicit cyber activities, studying these forums is crucial for cyber defense.\nTo help with this task, we’ve listed the most popular hacker forums in 2023.\nWhat are the top forums on the deep and dark web in 2023?\nLet’s take a look at the top\ndeep and dark web\nforums, listed in no particular order.\n#1. BreachForums\nLaunched:\nJune 2023\nMain language:\nEnglish\nBreachedForums\nre-emerged in June 2023\n, three months after it went offline, as a leading dark web forum. The new site was relaunched by the ShinyHunters hacker group, a known cybercriminal gang who have hacked into Microsoft, NitroPDF, Pixlr, Mathway, Mashable, Bonobos, etc., stealing the data of millions of users in 2020 and 2021.\nThose who are familiar with the original BreachForums will immediately notice that the renewed site looks a lot alike, with an almost identical design and structure. However, it has appeared under different domains, including domains on the open web and Tor. It features many of the old stolen databases that the original BreachForums hosted and new data containing databases of compromised or leaked data, documents, and compromised accounts.\nBreachedForums has become a hub for data breaches, boasting a “Databases” section with over 900 distinct official datasets, encompassing more than 15 billion records. The forum’s popularity is evident with over 60,000 users and more than 200,000 posts.\nOne of the posts on BreachForums a crypter to bypass antivirus detection of malicious code\nThe site also features diverse sections such as cracking, marketplace, tutorials, and scripts, catering to a wide range of interests within its community.\n#2. Exploit.in\nLaunched:\n2005\nMain language:\nEnglish, Russian\nExploit.in is another notorious dark web forum known for hosting extensive discussions on various cybercriminal activities. It is a hub for topics like social engineering, security vulnerabilities, hacking of social networks, cryptography, privacy and anonymity, and malware programming, with a particular emphasis on sharing exploits and vulnerabilities in computer systems. This focus is reflected in the forum’s name, “Exploit.in”\nThis forum also operates as a clandestine marketplace, where users trade illegal digital products, including malware, and offer various hacking and carding services.\nA post on Exploit.in, where a threat actor is offering ECE exploit for a fee\nIt’s a highly active forum, hosting over 80,000 active threat actors who have collectively contributed to more than one million posts, exchanging and disseminating information related to hacking.\n#3. XSS.is\nLaunched:\n2004\nMain language:\nRussian\nXSS.is\nis a well-known dark web forum that has been around since at least 2004, making it a veteran among today’s active underground forums. It was originally known as DaMaGeLab but changed its name to XSS in 2018. A leading speculation is that it was the result of the arrest of one of its admins over the operation of the Andromeda botnet.\nA post published on the XSS forum by a user who’s looking to buy illegal hacking tools\nThe XSS.IS forum is a highly professional hacking forum with sections on hacking, corporate access, database leaks, competitive intelligence, and even a key recruiting and PR ground for Ransomware-As-A-Service (RaaS) operations.\n#4. Dread\nLaunched:\nFebruary 2018\nMain language:\nEnglish\nDread is a dark web forum operating on the Tor network, which resembles Reddit in its functionality. Coincidentally or not, it gained prominence in 2018 when Reddit shut down several forums dedicated to discussing darknet markets. Within just three months of its inception, Dread attracted over 12,000 users.\nToday,\nDread\nis also noted for the anonymity it offers its users, making it a go-to platform for not just hacking-related topics, but also for drug-related discussions and transactions. It’s recognized as a crucial hub in the dark web community, and some compare it to Reddit. It boasts professional posts on hacking, comprehensive guides on software manipulation and carding, and discussions on illegal drug trade and stolen data exchange.\nA post on Dread where a new user is looking for advice on where they can get the “right drugs”\nDread also serves as a news source for significant events in the dark web, like the closure of major marketplaces.\n#5. Blackforums\nLaunched:\n2022\nMain language:\nEnglish\nBlackforums is another known forum in the deep web, which mainly focuses on the illegal exploitation of vulnerabilities, which is also known as “black hat hacking” of applications, software, and websites.\nIt’s a significantly smaller forum than others on the list, with 3120 members and less than 10,000 posts.\nThe forum contains sections such as hacking, data leaks from various hacks, coding tips and assistance (tools and guidance) especially when it comes to black hat hacking, and a marketplace where sellers offer illegal goods to potential customers.\nIt also invites its members to request “jobs” or designed and customized tools and tutorials. The forum contains a lot of database leaks, some are public or are offered for free and others are offered for a fee. The forum contains a lot of “how to” questions regarding illegal web activities in general and more specifically, malicious exploitation of services for personal gain.\nA user on Blackforums looking for advice on how to deface a static website\nWhat’s next for deep and dark web forums in 2024?\nThe world of deep and dark web forums is ever-changing with some closing and others emerging. But successful hacker forums will continue to exist, under one name or another, because the need for the resources they provide will remain in place in 2024. With the rise of new technologies, such as generative AI, that can be abused for malicious purposes, we expect to see these forums and cybercriminal discussions and activities continue to rise.\nThe hacker forums we have mentioned above represent just a fraction of the dark web platforms we at Webz.io monitor. As the frequency of cyber and ransomware incidents continues to rise, monitoring these forums plays an increasingly important role in identifying, preventing, and addressing hacking attempts and data breaches.\nContact us\nto learn how to protect businesses and organizations with dark web monitoring.\nCompromised PII\nCVEs\nHacking Forums\nTrending\nWebz\nSpread the News\nPrevious Post\nNext Post\nNot subscribed to our Dark Web Pulse updates?\nBy submitting you agree to Webz.io's\nPrivacy Policy\nand further marketing communications.\nRead More\nJanuary 24, 2022\nCould Panasonic’s Breach Have Been Prevented?\nOn November 26, 2021, Panasonic joined a long list of companies that suffered a data breach over the past year.

It hosts both legal and illegal activities,\n    offering anonymity but also posing risks like scams and illicit content.\nWhat is the dark web, deep web, and surface web?\nThe Internet is sizable with millions of web pages, databases, and servers all run 24 hours a day. But the so-called \"visible\" Internet (aka surface web or open web) — sites that can be found using search engines like Google and Yahoo — is just the tip of the iceberg.\nThere are several terms surrounding the non-visible Web, but it's worth knowing how they differ if you're planning to browse off the beaten path.\nThe surface web or open web\nThe open web, or surface web,\nis the “visible” surface layer. If we continue to visualize the entire web like an iceberg, the open web would be the top portion that’s above the water. From a statistical standpoint, this collective of websites and data makes up under 5% of the total internet.\nAll commonly public-facing websites accessed via traditional browsers like Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox are contained here. Websites are usually labeled with registry operators like “.com” and “.org” and can be easily located with popular search engines.\nLocating surface web websites is possible because search engines can index the web via visible links (a process called “crawling” due to the search engine traveling the web like a spider).\nThe deep web\nThe deep web\nrests below the surface and accounts for approximately 90% of all websites. This would be the part of an iceberg beneath the water, much larger than the surface web. In fact, this hidden web is so large that it's impossible to discover exactly how many pages or websites are active at any one time.\nCarrying on with the analogy, big search engines could be considered like fishing boats that can only \"catch\" websites close to the surface. Everything else, from academic journals to private databases and more illicit content, is out of reach. This deep web also includes the portion that we know as\nthe dark web\n.\nWhile many news outlets use \"deep web\" and \"dark web\" interchangeably, much of the deep portion as a whole is perfectly legal and safe. Some of the largest parts of the deep web include:\nDatabases:\nboth public and privately protected file collections that are not connected to other areas of the web, only to be searched within the database itself.\nIntranets:\ninternal networks for enterprises, governments, and educational facilities used to communicate and control aspects privately within their organizations.\nIn case you’re wondering how to access the deep web, chances are you already use it daily. The term \"deep web\" refers to all web pages that that are unidentifiable by search engines. Deep web sites may be concealed behind\npasswords\nor other security walls, while others simply tell search engines to not “crawl” them. Without visible links, these pages are more hidden for various reasons.\nOn the larger deep web, its “hidden” content is generally cleaner and safer. Everything from blog posts in-review and pending web page redesigns, to the pages you access when you bank online, are part of the deep web. Furthermore, these pose no threat to your computer or safety at large. Most of these pages are kept hidden from the open web to protect user information and privacy, such as:\nFinancial accounts like banking and retirement\nEmail and social messaging accounts\nPrivate enterprise databases\nHIPPA sensitive information like medical documentation\nLegal files\nVenturing further into the deep web does bring a bit more danger to the light. For some users, portions of the deep web offer the opportunity to bypass local restrictions and access TV or movie services that may not be available in their local areas. Others go somewhat deeper to download pirated music or steal movies that aren't yet in theaters.\nAt the dark end of the web, you’ll find the more hazardous content and activity. Tor websites are located at this far end of the deep web, which are deemed the “dark web” and are only accessible by an anonymous browser.\nDeep web safety is more relevant to the average internet user than dark web safety, as you could end up in dangerous areas by accident: many portions of the deep web can still be accessed in normal internet browsers. This is how users can travel through enough tangential pathways and end up on a piracy site, a politically radical forum, or viewing disturbingly violent content.\nThe dark web\nThe dark web\nrefers to sites that are not indexed and only accessible via specialized web browsers. Significantly smaller than the tiny surface web, the dark web is considered a part of the deep web. Using our ocean and iceberg visual, the dark web would be the bottom tip of the submerged iceberg.\nThe dark web, however, is a very concealed portion of the deep web that few will ever interact with or even see. In other words, the deep web covers everything under the surface that's still accessible with the right software,\nincluding\nthe dark web.\nBreaking down the construction of the dark web reveals a few key layers that make it an anonymous haven:\nNo webpage indexing\nby surface web search engines. Google and other popular search tools cannot discover or display results for pages within the dark web.\n“Virtual traffic tunnels”\nvia a randomized network infrastructure.\nInaccessible by traditional browsers\ndue to its unique registry operator. Also, it's further hidden by various network security measures like firewalls and encryption.\nThe reputation of the dark web has often been linked to criminal intent or illegal content, and \"trading\" sites where users can purchase illicit goods or services. However, legal parties have made use of this framework as well.\nWhen it comes to dark web safety, the deep web dangers are very different from dark web dangers.\nIllegal cyber activity\ncannot necessarily be stumbled upon easily but tends to be much more extreme and threatening if you do seek it out. Before we unpack the dark web’s threats, let’s explore how and why users access these sites.\nHow to access the dark web\nThe dark web was once the province of hackers, law enforcement officers, and cybercriminals. However, new technology like encryption and the anonymization browser software, Tor, now makes it possible for anyone to dive dark if they're interested.\nTor (“The Onion Routing” project)\nnetwork browser provides users access to visit websites with the “. onion” registry operator. This browser is a service originally developed in the latter part of the 1990s by the United States Naval Research Laboratory.\nUnderstanding that the nature of the internet meant a lack of privacy, an early version of Tor was created to hide spy communications. Eventually, the framework was repurposed and has since been made public in the form of the browser we know today. Anyone can download it free of charge.\nThink of Tor as a web browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Notably, instead of taking the most direct route between your computer and the deep parts of the web, the Tor browser uses a random path of encrypted servers known as \"nodes.\" This allows users to connect to the deep web without fear of their actions being tracked or their browser history being exposed.\nSites on the deep web also use Tor (or similar software such as I2P, the “Invisible Internet Project”) to remain anonymous, meaning you won't be able to find out who's running them or where they're being hosted.\nIs it illegal to go on the dark web?\nSimply put, no it is not illegal to access the dark web. In fact, some uses are perfectly legal and support the value of the “dark web.” On the dark web, users can seek out three clear benefits from its use:\nUser anonymity\nVirtually untraceable services and sites\nAbility to take illegal actions for both users and providers\nAs such, the dark web has attracted many parties who would otherwise be endangered by revealing their identities online. Abuse and persecution victims, whistleblowers, and political dissidents have been frequent users of these hidden sites. But of course, these benefits can be easily extended to those that want to act outside of the constraints of laws in other explicitly illegal ways.\nWhen viewed through this lens, the dark web’s legality is based on how you as a user engage with it. You might fall to the wayside of legal lines for many reasons that are important for the protection of freedom. Others may act in ways that are illegal for the protection and safety of others. Let’s unpack both of these concepts in terms of the “dark web browser” and the websites themselves.\nIs Tor illegal to use?\nOn the software end, the use of Tor and other\nanonymized browsers\nis not strictly illegal. In fact, these supposed “dark web” browsers are not tethered exclusively to this portion of the internet. Many users now leverage Tor to browse both the public Internet and the deeper parts of the web privately.\nThe privacy offered by the Tor browser is important in the current digital age. Corporations and governing bodies alike currently participate in unauthorized surveillance of online activity. Some simply don't want government agencies or even Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to know what they're looking at online, while others have little choice. Users in countries with strict access and user laws are often prevented from accessing even public sites unless they use Tor clients and\nvirtual private networks\n(VPNs).\nHowever, you can still take illegal actions within Tor that could incriminate you regardless of the browser’s legality. You could easily use Tor in an attempt to pirate copyrighted content from the deep web, share illegal pornography, or engage in cyber terrorism. Using a legal browser will not make your actions fall to the right side of the law.\nAre sites on the dark web illegal to use and visit?\nOn the network end, the dark web is a bit more of a grey area. The use of the dark web usually means that you are attempting to engage in activity that you could not otherwise carry out in the public eye.\nFor government critics and other outspoken advocates, they may fear backlash if their real identities were discovered. For those who have endured harm at the hands of others, they may not want their attackers to discover their conversations about the event. If an activity is deemed illegal by the governing bodies you fall under, then it would be illegal.\nThat said, anonymity comes with a dark side since criminals and malicious hackers also prefer to operate in the shadows. For example, cyberattacks and trafficking are activities that the participants know will be incriminating. They take these actions to the dark web to hide for this reason.\nUltimately, simply browsing these spaces is not illegal but can be an issue for you. While it is not illegal as a whole, unsavory activity does live in many parts of the dark web. It can expose you to unnecessary risks if you are not careful or an advanced, computer savvy user aware of its threats. So, what is the dark web used for when it’s used for illegal activity?\nTypes of threats on the dark web\nIf you’re considering using the dark web for basic privacy purposes you might still question, “Is dark web dangerous to use?” Unfortunately, it very much can be a dangerous place to be. Below are some common threats you may face during your browsing experiences:\nMalicious software\nMalicious software — i.e. malware — is fully alive all across the dark web. It is often offered in some portals to give threat actors the tools for cyberattacks. However, it also lingers all across the dark web to infect unsuspecting users just like it does on the rest of the web.\nThe dark web doesn’t carry as many of the social contracts that website providers follow to protect users on the rest of the web. As such, users can find themselves regularly exposed to some types of malware like:\nKeyloggers\nBotnet malware\nRansomware\nPhishing malware\nIf you choose to pursue exploring any sites on the dark web, you put yourself at risk of being singled out and targeted for hacks and more. Most malware infections can be caught by your\nendpoint security programs\n.\nThe threats of online browsing can extend into the unplugged world if your computer or network connection can be exploited. Anonymity is powerful with Tor and the framework of the dark web, but it is not infallible. Any online activity can carry breadcrumbs to your identity if someone digs far enough.\nGovernment monitoring\nWith many Tor-based sites being overtaken by police authorities across the globe, there is a clear danger of becoming government target for simply visiting a dark website.\nIllegal drug marketplaces like the Silk Road have been hijacked for police surveillance in the past. By utilizing custom software to infiltrate and analyze activity, this has allowed law officials to discover user identities of patrons and bystanders alike. Even if you never make a purchase, you could be watched and incriminate yourself for other activities later in life.\nInfiltrations can put you at risk of monitoring for other types of activity as well. Evading government restrictions to explore new political ideologies can be an imprisonable offense in some countries. China uses what is known as the “Great Firewall” limit access to popular sites for this exact reason. The risk of being a visitor to this content could lead to being placed on a watchlist or immediate targeting for a jail sentence.\nScams\nSome alleged services like the professional “hitmen” may just be scams designed to profit from willing customers. Reports have suggested the dark web offers many illegal services, from paid assassinations to trafficking for sex and weapons.\nSome of these are well-known, established threats that circulate in this nook of the web. However, others may be taking advantage of the dark web’s reputation to trick users out of large sums of money. Also, some users on the dark web may attempt\nphishing scams\nto steal your identity or personal information for extortion.\nYour Digital Safety is at Risk!\nDid you know the dark web is a hotspot for stolen personal data, malware, and online threats?

All types of personal data can be distributed online for a profit. Passwords, physical addresses, bank account numbers, and social security numbers circulate in the dark web all the time. You may already be aware that malicious actors can use these to harm your credit, engage in financial theft, and breach of your other online accounts. Leaks of personal data can also lead to damage to your reputation via social fraud.\nAntimalware and antivirus protections\nare equally crucial to prevent malicious actors from exploiting you. The dark web is filled with information theft from malware-infected users. Attackers can use tools like keyloggers to gather your data, and they can infiltrate your system on any part of the web. Internet security software like\nKaspersky Premium\nare comprehensive to cover both identity monitoring and antivirus defenses.\nHow to access the dark web safely\nIf you have a legitimate or viable need to access the dark web, you’ll want to make sure you stay safe if you decide to use it.\n7 Tips for safe access to the dark web\nTrust your intuition.\nTo avoid being scammed, you’ll want to protect yourself with smart behavior on the web. Not everyone is who they seem. Staying safe requires that you watch who you talk to and where you visit. You should always take action to remove yourself from a situation if something doesn’t feel right.\nDetach your online persona from real life.\nYour username, email address, “real name,” password, and even your credit card should never be used anywhere else in your life. Create brand-new throwaway accounts and identifiers for yourself if necessary. Acquire prepaid, unidentifiable debit cards before making any purchases. Do not use anything that could be used to identify you — whether online or in real life.\nEmploy active monitoring of identify and financial theft.\nMany online security services now offer identity protection for your safety. Be sure to take advantage of these tools if they are made available to you.\nExplicitly avoid dark web file downloads.\nFear of malware infection is significantly higher in the lawless territory that is the dark web. Real-time file scanning from an antivirus program can help you check any incoming files in case you do opt to download.\nDisable ActiveX and Java in any available network settings.\nThese frameworks are notorious for being probed and exploited by malicious parties. Since you are traveling through a network filled with said threats, you’ll want to avoid this risk.\nUse a secondary non-admin local user account for all daily activities.\nThe native account on most computers will have full administrative permissions by default. Most malware must take advantage of this to execute its functions. As such, you can slow or halt the progress of exploitation by limiting the account in-use to strict privileges.\nAlways restrict access to your Tor-enabled\ndevice.\nProtect your children or other family members so they aren't at risk of stumbling across something no one should ever see. Visit the Deep Web if you're interested, but don't let kids anywhere near it.\nRelated Articles:\nWhat is a Keylogger?\nWhat is a Botnet?\nWays hackers can violate your online privacy\nHow to detect spyware to safeguard your privacy\nSpecial Offer\nGet 10% off\nKaspersky Premium\n!\nDon’t pass up this\nspecial offer\nfor better cybersecurity.\nWhat is the Deep and Dark Web?\nKaspersky\nLearn about dark web, deep web, and surface web.

Why do These Exist?\nThose who advocate anonymity, freedom of expression, and privacy heavily use the dark web. Although most people are unaware of this part of the Internet, the\ndark web\nis an important part of the Internet. Since websites are kept unindexed here, it is more complex and difficult to search for source content and obtain data than the clear web. While many people use this hidden part of the Internet, many use it to carry out illegal activities. The biggest reason malicious users prefer to use the\ndark web\nis that special software is used to enter the web pages here, providing anonymity and privacy.\nDark web forums\ngenerally contain illegal trade, malware, 0day, exploit, database leakage, credit card information, etc. There are many different data. Dark web forums are one of the important sources for threat intelligence research at this point. We recommend you take a look at our\nTop 10 Dark Web Search Engine\nblog post that we have previously published.\nIs Monitoring Dark Web Forums Important? Why?\nMonitoring\ndark web forums\nis an important source for analyzing current cyber threats. Today, although threat actors broadcast their illegal activities via applications such as telegram, dark web forums are still one of the current content sources. According to the analyses made by ThreatMon analysts, there are important findings detected and obtained from dark web forums as the first source. With the detection of exploits, zero days, malware, etc. content obtained from dark web forums, proactive intelligence is developed by analyzing current malware. Similarly, with the detection of databases, credit cards, sensitive information, etc. leaks obtained from forums, target sectors, and countries are identified and information is obtained to strengthen the defense of the relevant institutions and organizations and take measures to prevent a possible attack.\nHow does ThreatMon Monitor the Dark Forums?\nThreatMon’s dark web monitoring service enables proactive detection and monitoring of corporate information or sensitive credentials shared on forums. Cyber Threat Intelligence Analysts perform open source intelligence (OSINT) analyses on the dark web to gather clues and better understand threats. It allows ThreatMon to mitigate risks, protect customer data, and reduce the impact of cyber threats such as identity theft, fraud, or data breaches.\nYou can protect your company with\nThreatMon’s dark web monitoring\nto safeguard your reputation.\nTop 10 Dark Web Forums to Monitor\n1. Breach\nIn 2022, following the closure of RaidForums, a very popular forum founded in 2015, Breached was established in a similar format to RaidForums. After the FBI arrested Pompompurin, the owner of Breached, in March 2023, Breached was also seized and the forum was closed and moved to a new forum called Breached, which was also closed in March 2023. To fill the void left by these closures, a new forum called ‘Exposed’ was opened. The forum with a similar theme and name was opened to users, and this brought to mind the question of whether it was a game of the FBI. Although the new forums were similar to the Breach forum, the fear that the new site was secretly monitored and possibly managed by the FBI caused many former Breached members to be suspicious. The newly launched Breach soon reached many users and shared many database leaks. It is still one of the most important forums and users can create an account with free membership. With the credit system in the forum, users can obtain credits. The most popular topic of the Breach forum is database leakage, but it also takes an active role in illegal sales. At the time of this report, the current Breach forum has 25,982 threads, 273,586 posts, and 78,687  members.\n2. Exploitin\nIn 2022, following the closure of RaidForums, a very popular forum established in 2015, Exploitin, an important Russian forum, has been actively used for cyber attacks and crimes since about 2012. Within the forum, there are regular sales of categorized cybercrime tools, trading in database leaks, credit card information leaks, malware sales, and even ransomware sales for ransom services. Compared to other forums, their membership policy is stricter. New memberships require a fee and an invitation from an existing member. At the time of writing, the Exploitin forum has 213,672 topics, 1,337,208 posts, and 60,856 members.\n3. XSS\nXSS, a Russian forum, has been actively used for cyber attacks since about 2013. The forum contains a significant amount of exploits, zero-day exploits, and malware. The forum is also popular for access sales and contains illegal sales that can be used for first access in Ransomware activities. Again, like the Breach forum, XSS offers free user account creation. There is a credit system for transactions within the forum. When writing this report, the XSS forum has 81,002 threads, 625,178 messages, and 58,902 members.\n4. Nulled\nNulled is a dark web forum that has been operating since 2015. To date, this forum has 5,131,238 users and hosts 33 million posts. Nulled dark web forum attracts attention with fake identity documents, malware creation tools, and databases. In 2016, as a result of a data breach by cyber hackers, 9.45 GB of personal information of users was disclosed.\n5. Altenen\nFounded in 2008, Altenen has 1.3 million users and 1,264,546 posts. The Altenen dark web forum, which is famous for credit card fraud, also produces fake IDs and passports. In 2018, the founder was caught and the first forum was closed. After the arrest of the founder, the dark web forum continues to be actively used, managed by another user with the address Altenen.nz.\n6. Hydra Market\nHydra Market was founded in 2015 and has 17 million users to date. The dark web platform, which is actively used in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States countries, hosts forged documents, data breaches, databases, illegal products, and more. To access the Hydra Market, it remained strong, secure, and confidential by continuing its activities with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin over the Tor network. In 2022, due to operations carried out by German and US law enforcement agencies, Hydra Market was closed, and its servers and $543 million in cryptocurrency were seized. Hydra Market became active again after a while.\n7. Sinister\nSinister is a dark web forum founded in 2016 and has 62 thousand users to date. Sinister attracts the attention of its users with topics such as various tools, social engineering techniques, and cracked programs.\n8. Cracked\nCracked was founded in 2016 and has 4.27 million users. The Cracked Dark Web forum hosts posts on exploit development, zero-day exploits, user logins, and cybersecurity. Cracked is not an illegal platform and is used by cybersecurity experts and penetration testers.\n9. Cracking\nCracking is one of the most important forums of its kind. This is a forum where cybercriminals can discuss various cracking tools, combo lists and dumps, tools, proxies, premium accounts, and more. When writing this report, the Cracking forum has 226,815 threads, 2,084,807 messages, and 484,239 members.\n10. Leakbase\nLeakBase, which has an important place for database leaks, emerged in 2023. The forum focuses on database leaks and includes a community that challenges the Breach forum. The forum is free to join and member status can be upgraded within the forum. Active database leaks are shared in the forum mainly by the staff team. When we look at the content, it is seen that there are user accounts, logs, various software, tools, and training pieces other than database leaks. When writing this report, the LeakBase forum has 14,275 threads, 93,258 messages, and 45,946 members.\nMore posts\nPeek into Monthly Vulnerabilities: September 2024\nOctober 9, 2024\nServiceNow Data Leak: Risks of Misconfigured Knowledge Bases\nSeptember 18, 2024\nPeek into Monthly Vulnerabilities: July 2024\nAugust 12, 2024\nSecuring the Games: Cyber Strategies for Paris Olympics 2024\nAugust 9, 2024\nHunter’s Lens: Russian Influence Operations Targeting the Paris Olympics 2024\nAugust 2, 2024\nView All\nShare this article\nFound it interesting?

There’s a good chance I have friends (and maybe you do too) who think Reddit is part of the dark web or that the worst of the web is only accessible overseas. The reality? The dark web is an enormous part of an Underground Economy, full of forums and marketplaces where criminals conduct illegal activity, often anonymously and without interruption. As such, keeping a pulse on dark web forums is a key component in protecting your business, your customers, and yourself, disrupting adversary threats at the source.\nIn this post, we'll cover what you need to know about dark web forums and how to integrate dark web forum monitoring into your external cybersecurity strategy.\nDownload the eBook, Fact vs. Fear: Dark Web Threats Teams Need to Focus On.\nWho and What Are Dark Web Forums (DWFs)?\nThe surface web is by far the most familiar and accessible portion of the internet. It is home to public-facing, searchable websites, yet it only\ncontains 0.03% of all information on the WWW\n. The other 99.7% of the online world is what you’d call the\ndeep and dark web\n; it’s comprised of restricted networks, web properties, content, and data and can’t be accessed using Google and other conventional search engines.\nThe dark web isn’t one single website, and it’s not typically accessible to users via the surface web. Instead, the dark web consists of a network of\nunderground marketplaces,\nforums, and encrypted chat channels.\nSpecifically, the dark web includes all of the content that exists on darknets, overlay networks that use the internet but can only be accessed by specific browsing software, authorizations, and encryption. Most darknets are small peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, but there are also larger, well-known darknets like Tor, Freenet, and I2P.\nA dark web forum (DWF) is a forum or platform where members can freely discuss illegal activity. Often, these criminal activities involve the sale of PII, illicit goods, or drugs; corporate espionage; plans of physical violence; vulnerabilities and phishing kits; and even human trafficking or child pornography. Dark web forums can also be the site of dark web marketplaces for the transactions of illegal or illicit actions.\nPeople often become confused about the dark web vs. dark web forums and marketplaces. For example, during the\nfall of the Silk Road marketplace\nin 2013, media outlets repeatedly used the term “Dark Web” in reference to the Tor network on which Silk Road was hosted, and which can only be accessed using the encrypted Tor browser. As a result, many people believe that the Tor browser is the dark web or a dark web forum, when in reality, it’s only one small part of it.\nWho is Behind Dark Web Forums?\nOften, dark web forums are not owned by a singular entity and are\nincredibly resilient\n. They may be owned by individuals, crime groups, or nation-states who are seeking to cause harm.\nDark web forums can be owned and run by anyone. Dark web vendors (and the marketplaces where they operate) take advantage of the encryption and anonymity provided by hidden darknets like\nThe Onion Router (TOR)\n,\nI2P\n, and\nZeroNet\nto hide their illicit activities from the FBI or other law enforcement and escape accountability for their actions.\nIn many cases, when a dark web forum is removed or taken down by law enforcement, it resurges under a new name. This is similar to the\nactions of ransomware operations\n.\nHow do Dark Web Forums (DWFs) Work?\nSimilar to Reddit-style forums, dark web forums typically consist of a series of subsites for specific topics. These topics may include the sale of personal information (PII), sale or access to\nmalware-as-a-service software\n, plans for physical attacks, and other nefarious activities.\nDark web forums are hosted on darknets, sometimes only accessible through specific encrypted web browsers. These are largely unmoderated communities with international subscribers or accounts. Law enforcement agencies may attempt to monitor these forums, but are often unable to keep up with the sheer volume of information being posted on a daily basis.\nCan You be Tracked on Dark Web Forums?\nOn the surface web, users are often tracked by website cookies. These cookies track your site visits to better understand and target consumers with ads. But, since the dark web doesn’t function on the surface web, people often have the misconception that they aren’t being tracked.\nYour ISP may not be able to track your actions on the dark web, but it can track you to the TOR entry node. Meaning that although your router might not see what you’re doing, it knows you have entered the dark web.\nThat brings us to another level of tracking. In truth, bad actors can track you on the dark web. Cybercriminals may track your online movement without your knowledge through malware or other points of entry. So, while you may be free of tracking from your ISP on the dark web, there’s a myriad of others who may have eyes on you.\nAre DWFs Here to Stay?\nJust as crime is here to stay, dark web forums aren’t going anywhere any time soon. Unfortunately, it is often the case that when one dark web forum is removed or shut down, another becomes available.\nIt’s important to note: accessing darknets using specialized software like the TOR browser is completely legal in the United States. With that being said, users can always face legal consequences for crimes they commit on the internet, including things like purchasing illicit drugs, accessing banned content, and engaging in piracy or fraud.\nWhat Are Some Popular Dark Web Forums?\nThe ZeroFox Dark Ops team has provided insights on five of the most popular dark web forums and marketplaces in 2022.\nXSS[.]is\nPrimarily Russian-language deep and dark web forum with a large community of users from CIS countries. Next to Exploit, this is the most serious underground hacker community, knowledgeable in a wide variety of malicious tools, hacking, initial access brokering, data exfiltration, ransomware, etc.\nExploit[.]in\nAlmost exclusively Russian-language deep and dark web forum with layered tiers of membership based on forum clout. Topics in higher tiers are considered very sensitive where the most well-regarded actors coordinate, including potential nation state actors/groups. This forum is more collaborative with regard to the development of malicious tools, initial access actors, and ransomware actors, but the majority of this communication takes place off-forum in various encrypted chat services. Fewer data and malicious tools sales than XSS, but contains probably the most sophisticated group of threat actors on the planet.\nBreached[.]to\nSuccessor to the now defunct RaidForums, Breached contains a large variety of threat actors, both in sophistication and areas of expertise. The majority of this forum are unsophisticated threat actors (aka script kiddies), that rely on the knowledge and tools of others to carry out malicious attacks. This forum easily contains the largest public trading, sharing and selling of compromised data of any other DDW forum/Marketplace. Since the arrest of the former admin of RaidForums (Omnipotent), Breached is run by a highly respected admin, who enforces arguably better security protocol and has over 134,000 users, as of writing.\nGenesis[.]market\nGenesis Market is among the more reputable and popular automated marketplaces selling access to data derived from infected devices.Genesis maintains its edge over other botnet marketplaces by providing some logs that update themselves in real time, meaning that if a victim changed their password their updated credentials would be sent to the person who purchased the botnet log.This is accomplished through tools offered to members in the form of their private browser and browser plugin-in that makes it possible for the buyer to imitate the digital signature of the victim’s device.\nRussianmarket[.]gs\nRussian Market (AKA russianmarket[.]gs) is a large well-regarded Deep Web forum similar to Genesis Market, both of which broker in botnet logs. Russian Market, in addition to selling malware logs, also brokers compromised carding data, RDP (remote desktop protocol) instances, credential stuffing malware, and other similar offerings.\nHow to Stop Dark Web Forums from Endangering Your Digital Security\nDark web forums pose a risk to businesses and people alike.

This operation will also help law enforcement agencies continue to combat the trafficking of illicit goods and services on the Darknet through the identification of new smuggling networks and trends.\nLaw enforcement agencies participating in the operation included: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Secret Service (USSS),  Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI) Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and various state and local entities.\nInternational partners included Europol the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency; Australian Federal Police; New Zealand Police and New Zealand Customs Service; Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada Post and Canada Border Services Agency;\nThe Netherlands\n; French Customs National Intelligence and Investigations Directorate; Finnish Customs; Swedish Police Authority and Swedish Customs; Ireland’s Garda National Drugs & Organised Crime Bureau; and Spain’s Guardia Civil.\nThe operation was supported by CBP’s National Targeting Center and coordinated by HSI’s Cyber Division.\nUpdated:\n06/09/2020\nReturn to top\nMedia Inquiries\nFor media inquiries about ICE activities, operations, or policies, contact the ICE Office of Public Affairs at\nICEMedia@ice.dhs.gov\n.\nAbout Us\nImmigration Enforcement\nCombating Transnational Crime\nNewsroom\nICE Contact Center\nReport suspicious activity:\n1-866-DHS-2-ICE\nICE.gov\nAn official website of the\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\nICE USWDS Footer Links\nAbout ICE\nAccessibility\nFOIA Requests\nPrivacy Policy\nDHS.gov\nArchive\nNo FEAR Act Data\nSite Links\nPerformance Reports\nInspector General\nThe White House\nDHS Components\nUSA.gov\nMobile Menu Bar\nMenu\nSearch\nEn Español\nContact\nMain Navigation on Mobile Devices\nAbout Us\nMission\nWho We Are\nLeadership\nHistory\nInformation Library\nCareer Opportunities\nImmigration Enforcement\nIdentify and Arrest\nCriminal Apprehension Program\nFugitive Operations\nImmigration Authority Delegation Program 287(g)\nImmigration Detainers\nDetain\nDetention Facilities\nHealth Service Corps\nDetention Management\nFacility Inspections\nFamily Residential Standards\nRemove\nRecalcitrant Countries\nRemoval\nERO Statistics Dashboard\nCombating Transnational Crime\nOperational Priorities\nProtecting National Security\nPreventing Crimes of Exploitation\nSecuring the Border\nEnsuring Public Safety\nUpholding Fairness in Global Trade\nInvestigating Cybercrime\nCombating Financial Crime\nInvestigations\nOutreach Programs\nPartnerships & Centers\nRecognize & Report Crime\nNewsroom\nNews Releases and Statements\nFeature Stories\nMultimedia\nSocial Media\nSpeeches and Testimonies\nSearch\nSearch\nHome\nWho We Are\nNewsroom\nInformation Library\nContact ICE\nCareers\nEn Español"

The indictment charges Pavey and Hamilton with conspiring to engage in drug trafficking, computer fraud, access device fraud, counterfeiting, and money laundering.\nAccording to the charges, Pavey and Hamilton previously worked together to advertise and sell counterfeit U.S. currency on AlphaBay, a dark web marketplace for illicit goods that was\nshut down in 2017\n.Â  After the demise of AlphaBay, the two began operating Empire Market in 2018.Â\nVendors on Empire Market, according to the indictment, offered to sell various illicit goods and services, including controlled substances such as heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and LSD, as well as counterfeit currency and stolen credit card information, the indictment states. Buyers could browse the available goods and services by category, including âFraud,â âDrugs & Chemicals,â âCounterfeit Items,â and âSoftware & Malware.â After transactions were completed using cryptocurrency, buyers could review and rate their purchases on multiple criteria, including âstealth.â\nAs shown in TRM's graph visualizer, Empire Market was a large exchange with incoming exposure from many western-based VASPS and outgoing exposure to mixers, peer-to-peer marketplaces and other unhosted addresses.\nDuring the investigation, law enforcement seized cryptocurrency valued at $75 million at the time of the seizures, as well as cash and precious metals.\nAccording to analysis by TRM Labsâ blockchain intelligence team focused on darknet market ecosystems, Empire Market was one of the largest Western darknet markets in operation during the relevant period. Following the AlphaBay/Hansa Market takedowns in 2017 the Western darknet market ecosystem was in disarray, with darknet markets users confounded by the concept that law enforcement could takeover and covertly run darknet market infrastructure â law enforcement ran Hansa Market for approximately a month without any indication to users. During this period deposits to darknet markets dropped significantly and no new leader emerged as vendors and buyers tended to avoid darknet markers while the dust settled.\nIn stepped Empire Market which appeared in February 2018 (about 6-7 months after the demise of AlphaBay/Hansa) and soon became the leader of the Western darknet market ecosystem. The fact that its graphical user interface was built to resemble that of AlphaBay was purposely done to instill a sense of familiarity for users who had become accustomed to AlphaBay.\nUsers trumpeted Empire as a âsolid' platformâ with a great developer team. The darknet market was a classic escrow marketplace (i.e. users deposited funds into Empire and, only then, were able to make purchases). Empire quickly attracted new vendors and buyers and its reliability and features, coupled with low vendor bonds â that is, the cost of signing up as a vendor â a responsive moderator team, and the familiarity of the interface, turned it into a leader. At first Empire allowed weapons listings, but soon afterwards these were banned.\nIn August 2020 Empire suddenly exit-scammed with the darknet markets disappearance.\nThis case was, in part, investigated by HSI New Yorkâs\nEl Dorado Task Force\n, a money laundering task force comprised of more than 200 law enforcement personnel representing approximately 35 federal, state and local law enforcement and regulatory agencies. The EDTF encompasses a standalone Cyber Division and is on a mission to disrupt, dismantle or render ineffective organizations involved in the laundering of proceeds of narcotics trafficking and other financial crimes. Since its inception in 1992, the task force has been responsible for the seizure of approximately $600 million and more than 2100 arrests.\nThis is some text inside of a div block.\nSubscribe and stay up to date with our insights\nApril 28, 2022\nDarknet Markets Explained\nApril 5, 2022\nGermany's Federal Criminal Police Office Takes Down Hydra Darknet Marketplace\nDecember 6, 2022\nEight Months After Hydra Shutdown, New Russian-language Darknet Markets Are Filling the Void\nAccess our coverage of TRON, Solana and 23 other blockchains\nFill out the form to speak with our team about investigative professional services.\nServices of interest\nSelect\nTransaction Monitoring/Wallet Screening\nTraining Services\nTraining Services\nÂ\nTransaction Monitoring/Wallet Screening\nForensics\nKnow-Your-VASP\nProfessional Services\nTraining Services\nI would like to receive updates and offers from TRM Labs, including industry insights or invites to upcoming events.

From passports to credit cards, nothing is safe\nTue 24 Jul 2018 11.00 BST\nLast modified on Tue 24 Jul 2018 14.38 BST\nShare\nT\nhe darknet (or dark web) is one of the most fascinating vestiges of humanity we’ve ever seen. It’s an aggregated swamp of all the darkest aspects of internet activity – child abuse images, drug markets, gun shops, gore smut, stolen merchandise, anarchist guides, terrorist chats, identity theft, hacking services …\nI’m going to focus on the most potent of these tiers – hacking services.\nBrowsing porn in incognito mode isn't nearly as private as you think | Dylan Curran\nRead more\nI spent three weeks studying and translating FreeHacks, one of the largest hacking forums on the internet. It’s a Russian community which aims to collectively gather its resources in order to maximize efficiency and knowledge dispersement.\nIt works the same as any typical forum, you open up TOR\n(a specialized browser for browsing the dark web), paste in the URL, and land on a home page with various sub-forums split into different categories. The categories are varied and well-divided:\nHacker world news\nHumor\nHacking and security\nCarding (stealing credit cards and trying to cash them out on the internet)\nBotnet (a network of bots used to steal data and send spam, or perform DDOS attacks)\nElectronics and phreaking (phreaking is trying to break someone’s security network)\nBrutus (software used to crack passwords)\nDDOS (overwhelming a server with requests to shut it down)\nSEO-optimization\nProgramming\nWeb development\nMalware and exploits\nPrivate software\nClothing market (people who use stolen credit cards to buy clothes and resell them)\nFinancial operations\nDocumentation (passports, driving licenses, citizenships)\nBlacklist (a community judicial system).\nAs you can see, this forum covers a dizzying amount of illegal activity. The entire forum is in Russian – and has about 5,000 active members. This is just the tip of the iceberg, too; every sub-forum is split even further into dozens of other sub-forums. To document everything here would take me at least six months and encompass a full book.\nView image in fullscreen\nA screen grab of the forum.\nPhotograph: - screengrab\nWhen you attempt to register on the site, you’re met with a mission statement of sorts – a weird justification method for their own illegal activities. It seems pathological and ironic; these hackers who essentially get paid to make life more difficult for people try to justify it with a beguiling proclamation.\nThe word ‘hacker’ is incorrectly used in the meaning of ‘computer burglar’ by some journalists. We, hackers, refuse to accept such an interpretation of it and continue to imply the meaning of ‘someone who likes to program and enjoy it’\nAfter reading the above categories, do you think these people just enjoy some casual software development?\nOnce you go through the rigorous registration process where you have to declare why you want to join the forum, and what software development skills you have and want to learn, you are granted access to this treasure trove of illicit information.\nFor this article, I’m going to focus primarily on the hacking and security sub-forum.\nThe very first post I clicked on to is: “How to get someone’s physical address.” Not the most comforting topic to start off with, but here we are.\nA video is posted detailing a step-by-step process to reverse-query addresses, and cross-reference them against other websites. The method uses various sites such as\nwhois.com\nand some credit check websites. (That’s as much information as I can give without giving the tutorial myself.) Multiple users have a back-and-forth with one another, discussing the pros and cons of this method, as well as how to make it more efficient.\nOne user leaves a thorough dissection expanding on the current method. It allows the perpetrator to use a phishing website to grab the person’s location via the wifi access points around them. I can’t verify if this method works, but the Russian users certainly seem to think it does.\nThe next thread I ventured into is “The Grandfather’s Way of Hacking”, an eccentric title if I’ve ever seen one. Perhaps my Russian-English translating software is acting out, but I’ll take what it gives me.\nThe user describes how people have a distorted view of hackers, how they hack remote computers in basements by simply smashing their keyboard. They goes on to describe how the easiest method of penetration occurs through knowing the IP address of the target computer. Using Shared Resources, you can easily penetrate the fortified walls of a PC. The easiest method, however, is social engineering.\nIt’s fascinating to see how this community works together to take down 'western' systems and divulge chaos and profit from it\nSocial engineering, in terms of hacking, is when you use some clever psychology to make a member of a company trust you and bypass security protocol. A common one is to ring the customer support of a company, and mask your number to mimic that of an internal phone number. You then play the fool and say you can’t access a website where you normally could have, and that it’s important to access it for an angry client.\nYou then give the customer support agent a link to the website. The catch, is that you have made a fake website which has a Trojan ready to be deposited on to the agent’s computer. The hacker then has access to the company’s internal network.\nThis thread gives great detail in how to carry this out, going into a tutorial of how to mask your phone number, using IP range scanners, which Trojan viruses to use, what can be gained once you access the computer and how to get in, download everything and get out as quickly as possible.\nIt’s incredibly comprehensive, and the other Russian users thank him kindly and comment about how concise and informative this chaos-wreaking method is.\nIn 2016, a Turkish citizen hacked the Turkish government’s ID system and downloaded the national ID, name, address, date of birth and mother and father’s name of 49.6 million citizens. It was one of the biggest hard leaks we have ever seen.\nA member of this forum took credit for it, and posted links to the download of the Turkish citizen’s information. I have no doubt it’s true, judging from the user’s post history.\nAre your phone camera and microphone spying on you? | Dylan Curran\nRead more\nIt’s fascinating to see how this community works together to take down “western” systems and derive chaos and profit from it. Typically, hackers in first-world countries are terrified to work together due to the multiplicative risk of a group being caught. In Russia, however, the authorities don’t seem to care that these hackers are wreaking havoc on the west. They are left to their own devices, and most users on this forum have been regular members for over six years.\nA lot of the information on this forum is incredibly worrying, even if a lot of it is harmless 15-year-olds trying to be edgy and hack their friend’s phones. In any case, it’s important to know these communities exist. The dark underbelly of the internet isn’t going anywhere.\nExplore more on these topics\nHacking\nOpinion\nInternet\nInternet safety\ncomment\nShare\nReuse this content\nMore on this story\nMore on this story\nSilk Road bitcoins worth $1bn change hands after seven years\n4 Nov 2020\nUS election meddling: 71% of Russians believe Putin denial, poll finds\n21 Aug 2018\nUK organised crime gangs profit most in Europe from darknet drugs sales – report\n26 Nov 2019\nRussian hackers targeting conservative US thinktanks, Microsoft says\n21 Aug 2018\nWhy US elections remain 'dangerously vulnerable' to cyber-attacks\n13 Aug 2018\nGerman police shut down one of world's biggest dark web sites\n3 May 2019\nDark web blamed for rise in drugs sent by post from Netherlands\n25 Apr 2019\nFBI says Russians hacked hundreds of thousands of home and office routers\n25 May 2018\nGerman couple who sold son to paedophiles on darknet jailed\n7 Aug 2018\nUS and UK blame Russia for 'malicious' cyber-offensive\n16 Apr 2018\nComments\n(…)\nSign in\nor\ncreate your Guardian account\nto join the discussion\nMost viewed\nMost viewed\nThe Guardian view\nColumnists\nCartoons\nOpinion videos\nLetters\nNews\nOpinion\nSport\nCulture\nLifestyle\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning\nSign up for our email\nHelp\nComplaints & corrections\nSecureDrop\nWork for us\nPrivacy policy\nCookie policy\nTerms & conditions\nContact us\nAll topics\nAll writers\nDigital newspaper archive\nTax strategy\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nNewsletters\nAdvertise with us\nSearch UK jobs\nBack to top\n© 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In 2023, the\ndark web\nattracted an average of 2.7 million daily users, with Germany now leading as the country with the highest number of Tor users, surpassing the United States for the first time in years.\nToday’s cybercriminals spread their activities across multiple platforms, making them harder to track and shut down. Telegram channels supplement traditional onion sites, blurring lines between the dark web and more mainstream communication tools.\nThe dark web marketplaces are mainly defined into two categories. The first category includes classic marketplaces, which serve as one-stop shops for a wide range of illegal goods. These platforms sell everything from drugs and fake IDs to weapons and hacking tools, resembling a digital black-market bazaar.\nAs of 2020, nearly 57% of the dark web was estimated to contain illegal content, including violence and extremist platforms. Users can browse and purchase various illicit items, making these marketplaces a hub for unlawful activity. For instance, cybercriminals can buy credit card details with a $5,000 balance for just $110.\nThe second category consists of data stores, which specialize in stolen information. These sites cater to cybercriminals seeking valuable data, such as credit card numbers, login credentials, and personal information. In 2019, there were approximately 8,400 active sites on the dark web, selling thousands of products and services daily.\nRansomware\nand cryptocurrency-based crimes saw a significant increase in 2023, with a nearly $176 million rise compared to 2022. By supplying stolen data, these marketplaces fuel many online scams and identity theft operations, playing a critical role in the darker aspects of the internet.\nCyble Vision\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nDark Web Marketplaces\nSecurity researchers have been monitoring forums within the cybercriminal underworld to investigate the leading markets operating in 2024. Here are some of the most popular dark web marketplaces in 2024:\nAbacus Market:\nAbacus Market is a relatively new dark web marketplace and took over much of vacuum left by the AlphaBay takedown. With over 40,000 product listings and valued at around $15 million, it’s a sprawling marketplace and go-to destination for drugs, counterfeit items and cybercrime tools.\nSTYX Market:\nLaunched in 2023, STYX focuses on financial crime, providing stolen credit card data, hacked bank accounts and access to various cryptocurrency laundering tools. It maintains a very strict level of user verification and integration with an official Telegram account to provide real-time updates to users. Various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Monero can be used to make purchases.\nBrian’s Club:\nActive for a decade since 2014, it is a widely used credit card shop used to source stolen credit card information such as dumps, CVVs, Wholesale Accounts. Payment options include Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Cryptocheck. It has a bidding feature, with new batches of stolen data being frequently added.\nRussian Market:\nContrary to the name, the market operates primarily in English with a global audience and specializes in the sale of stolen data relating to credit card data, remote desktop protocol access credentials, stealer logs, personal information, BIN checkers, PayPal cookie converters, and several cybercrime related tools and utilities. The market is known for its accessible pricing ranges.\nBidenCash:\nLaunched in 2022, BidenCash has quickly become notorious for: Stolen credit card data, personal identifying information (PII), SSH credentials. What sets BidenCash apart: Aggressive marketing tactics, egular “free” data dumps to attract users, strict user verification process. BidenCash’s rapid rise and focus on financial data make it a significant concern for\ncybersecurity\nprofessionals.\nWeTheNorth:\nWeTheNorth is a Canadian market established in 2021 that also serves international users. It offers counterfeit documents, financial fraud tools, hacking and\nmalware\nservices. It has an active forum and community along with an extensive user vetting process.\nTorzon Market:\nLaunched in September 2022, Torzon Market operates on the Tor network and features over 11,600 illegal products, including drugs and hacking tools. It enhances buyer transparency by importing vendor feedback with PGP proof. Torzon offers a premium account option for additional benefits and is valued at approximately $15 million, accepting payments in Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR).\nShuttered Dark Web Marketplaces\nApart from the dark web markets that are operating online today, some raided platforms influenced many markets.\nWhile some of these markets were shuttered by law enforcement agencies – some took the easy way out with exit scams. Here are some of the now-defunct dark web markets that were notorious for cybercrime.\nMellow – Took voluntary exit in April 2023\nOmicron – Hacked in July 2022\nAlphabay – Exit scam in December 2022\nWorld Market – Exit scam in March 2022\nKingdom Market – Raided by law enforcement agencies in December 2023\nTor2door Market – Exit scam in September 2023\nVice City – Exit scam in July 2023\nAurora Market – Exit scam in May 2021\nToRReZ Market – Voluntary exit in December 2021\nGenesis – Exit scam in August 2019\nConclusion\nThese marketplaces incorporate increasingly popular tactics such as bidding systems, closed invites, extensive reviews, regionalization, use of regular social media resources and focus on anonymity as standards for\ndark web\nmarketplaces as well as their adaptations into more region-specific platforms.\nCybersecurity experts\nshould pay close attention to these trends, as they often indicate emerging threats and profit generation tactics among the cybercriminal forums.\nSources:\n1.\nhttps://preyproject.com/blog/dark-web-statistics-trends\n2.\nhttps://www.euda.europa.eu/data/repository/data-lifetime-and-reason-closure-global-darknet-markets-offering-drugs_en\nRelated\nDiscover how we help proactively defend against evolving threats with Gen 3 intelligence.\nRequest a Demo today!\nShare Post:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nRecent posts\nCERT-UA Warns of Malicious AnyDesk Requests Under the Pretex…\nJanuary 23, 2025\nAircraft Collision Avoidance Systems Hit by High-Severity IC…\nJanuary 23, 2025\nAustralian Cyber Security Centre Targets Bulletproof Hosting…\nJanuary 22, 2025\nCyble Finds Thousands of Security Vendor Credentials on Dark…\nJanuary 22, 2025\nJoCERT Issues Warning on Exploitable Command Injection Flaw…\nJanuary 21, 2025\nType your email…\nSubscribe\nRelated Topics\nJanuary 23, 2025\nExtended Threat Intelligence Explained: Everything You Need to Know\nJanuary 22, 2025\nHow Attack Surface Management Helps in Risk Reduction and Vulnerability Prevention\nJanuary 17, 2025\nThe Role of Threat Intelligence in Preventing Physical Security Breaches\nJanuary 16, 2025\nDeepfake Technology: A Growing Threat to Enterprise Security\nJanuary 13, 2025\nThe Need for Executive Monitoring in the APAC Region\nJanuary 10, 2025\nCloud Security Predictions for 2025: Trends to Watch in APAC and ANZ\nQuick Links\nMain Menu\nHome\nAbout Us\nBlog\nCyble Partner Network (CPN)\nPress\nResponsible Disclosure\nKnowledge Hub\nSitemap\nThreat Intelligence Products & Platforms\nMain Menu\nAmIBreached\nCyble Vision\nCyble Hawk\nCyble Odin\nThe Cyber Express\nSolutions\nMain Menu\nAttack Surface Management\nBrand Intelligence\nThreat Intelligence Platform\nDark Web Monitoring\nTakedown and Disruption\nVulnerability Management\nThird-Party Risk Management (TPRM)\nPhysical Threat Intelligence\nExecutive Monitoring\nCloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)\nBotShield\nIncident Management\nPrivacy Policy\nMain Menu\nAmIBreached\nCyble Vision\nCyble Trust Portal\nSchedule a Personalized Demo to Uncover Threats That No One Tells You\nBook a\nDemo\n© 2025.

Cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active leading up to major events like elections. Remaining vigilant and identifying and analyzing potential cyberthreats and vulnerabilities is crucial for preparing and safeguarding against the lures and targeted cyberattacks that could take advantage of a heightened moment in time and even disrupt or influence electoral outcomes.\n- Derek Manky, Chief Security Strategist and VP of Global Threat Intelligence at Fortinet\nNews Summary\nFortinet\n®\n(NASDAQ: FTNT), the global cybersecurity leader driving the convergence of networking and security, today released its FortiGuard Labs Threat Intelligence Report:\nThreat Actors Targeting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\n, which reveals and analyzes threats tied to U.S.-based entities, voters, and the electoral process. Key findings from the threat intelligence report include:\nPhishing Scams Targeting Voters Leading Up to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election:\nThreat actors are selling affordable phishing kits on the darknet designed to target voters and donors by impersonating the presidential candidates and their campaigns.\nMalicious Domain Registrations on the Rise:\nMore than 1,000 new potentially malicious domains have also been registered since the beginning of 2024 that follow particular patterns and incorporate election-related content and candidates, suggesting that threat actors are leveraging the heightened interest surrounding the election to lure unsuspecting targets and potentially conduct malicious activities.\nDarknet Landscape:\nBillions of records from the U.S. are for sale on darknet forums, including Social Security numbers (SSNs), personally identifiable information (PII), and credentials that could be used in misinformation campaigns and lead to fraudulent activity, phishing scams, and account takeover; approximately 3% of the posts on darknet forums involve databases related to business and government entities.\nRansomware Landscape:\nFortiGuard Labs researchers noted a 28% increase in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government year-over-year based on observed leak sites.\nScams Targeting the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election Flood the Darknet\nCyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active in the lead-up to elections.\nThe FortiGuard Labs research team observed threat actors selling distinct phishing kits for $1,260 each, created to impersonate U.S. presidential candidates. These kits are designed to harvest personal information, including names, addresses, and credit card (donation) details.\nSince January 2024, FortiGuard Labs researchers have also identified more than 1,000 newly registered domain names that incorporate election-related terms and references to prominent political figures. Fraudulent fundraising websites, including secure[.]actsblues[.]com, meant to imitate the legitimate site for ActBlue (secure[.]actblue[.]com), a nonprofit American fundraising platform and political action committee.\nThe top two most-used hosting providers for these election-themed websites are AMAZON-02 and CLOUDFLARENET. The reliance on major hosting platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare suggests that threat actors are leveraging these reputable services to enhance the legitimacy and resilience of their malicious domains.\nA notable concentration of domains is associated with a limited number of IP addresses, indicating a centralized approach by threat actors to efficiently manage multiple malicious domains to execute large-scale cyber campaigns.\nNo Shortage of Personal Data Being Sold Aimed at the U.S.\nFortiGuard Labs analysis continues to show a significant number of diverse databases available on darknet forums targeting the U.S., including SSNs, usernames, email addresses, passwords, credit card data, date of birth, and other PII that could be used to challenge the integrity of the 2024 U.S. election. Specific highlights include:\nOver 1.3 billion rows of combo lists, which include usernames, email addresses, and passwords, signify a considerable risk for credential-stuffing attacks. In such attacks, cybercriminals use these stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts, making it a valid and substantial security concern.\nThe discovery of 300,000 rows of credit card data, which include CVV, name, card number, expiration date, and date of birth, highlights potential financial fraud risks targeting voters and election officials.\nOver 2 billion rows of user databases on the darknet indicate a heightened exposure to identity theft and targeted phishing attacks.\n10% of the posts on darknet forums are associated with SSN databases, which poses a significant threat by increasing the risk of personal data breaches.\nThe U.S. Government Is an Increasingly Attractive Target\nRansomware attacks targeting government agencies before an election can impact the electoral process and public trust in government institutions. Compared to 2023, the FortiGuard Labs research team observed a 28% spike in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government in 2024.\nThe darknet has become a hub for U.S.-specific threats, where malicious actors trade sensitive information and can potentially develop strategies to exploit vulnerabilities. Approximately 3% of the posts on these forums involve databases related to business and government entities. These databases hold critical organizational data that is vulnerable to cyber exploits and are a prime target for threat actors as the elections come and go.\nRecommendations to Prevent and Mitigate Cyberattacks this Election Season\nCybersecurity measures are critical to safeguard the integrity of the U.S. 2024 presidential election. Following fundamental best practices can help prevent and mitigate the effects of cyber incidents. The full list of recommendations and best practices can be found in the report, but some key takeaways for citizens, business leaders, and election officials include:\nAlways remain vigilant for suspicious behavior or activity leading up to major events and prioritize good cyber hygiene.\nPrioritize employee training and awareness.\nEnforce multi-factor authentication and a strong-password policy.\nInstall endpoint protection solutions.\nPatch operating systems and web servers and update software regularly.\nAbout the Fortinet FortiGuard Labs Election Security Report\nThis report provides an in-depth analysis of threats observed from January 2024 to August 2024. It examines the diverse array of cyberthreats that may affect U.S.-based entities and the electoral process.\nAdditional Resources\nRead the full FortiGuard Labs Threat Intelligence Report:\nThreat Actors Targeting 2024 U.S. Presidential Election\n.\nLearn about\nFortiRecon\nand generating reports like this for your organization.\nLearn about\nFortiGuard Labs\nthreat intelligence and research and\nOutbreak Alerts\n, which provide timely steps to mitigate breaking cybersecurity attacks.\nLearn about\nFortinet's commitment to product security and integrity\n, including its responsible product development, vulnerability disclosure approach, and policies.\nFollow Fortinet on\nX\n,\nLinkedIn\n,\nFacebook\n, and\nInstagram\n.

In 2021, Hydra accounted for an estimated 80% of all darknet market-related cryptocurrency transactions, and since 2015, the marketplace has received approximately $5.2 billion in cryptocurrency.\nThe seizure of the Hydra servers and cryptocurrency wallets containing $25 million worth of bitcoin was made this morning in Germany by the German Federal Criminal Police (the Bundeskriminalamt), in coordination with U.S. law enforcement.\n“The Justice Department will be relentless in our efforts to hold accountable those who violate our laws – no matter where they are located or how they try to hide their crimes,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Together with our German law enforcement partners, we have seized the infrastructure of the world’s largest darknet market, but our work is far from over. We will continue to work alongside our international and interagency partners to disrupt and dismantle darknet markets, and to hold those who commit their crimes on the dark web accountable for their acts.”\n“The Department of Justice will not allow darknet markets and cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering and the sale of hacking tools and services,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “Our message should be clear: we will continue to go after darknet markets and those who exploit them. Together with our partners in Germany and around the world, we will continue our work to disrupt the ecosystem that allows these criminal actors to operate.”\nHydra was an online criminal marketplace that enabled users in mainly Russian-speaking countries to buy and sell illicit goods and services, including illegal drugs, stolen financial information, fraudulent identification documents, and money laundering and mixing services, anonymously and outside the reach of law enforcement. Transactions on Hydra were conducted in cryptocurrency and Hydra’s operators charged a commission for every transaction conducted on Hydra.\nIn conjunction with the shutdown of Hydra, the department also announced criminal charges against Dmitry Olegovich Pavlov, 30, a resident of Russia, for conspiracy to distribute narcotics and conspiracy to commit money laundering, in connection with his operation and administration of the servers used to run Hydra.\n“This coordinated action sends a clear message to anyone attempting to operate or support an online criminal enterprise under the cover of the dark web,” said U.S. Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds for the Northern District of California. “The dark web is not a place criminals can operate with impunity or hide from U.S. law enforcement, and we will continue to use our sophisticated tools and expertise to dismantle and disable darknet markets. This action also underscores the importance of international law enforcement collaboration. We thank German authorities and the Bundeskriminalamt, the German Federal Criminal Police Office, for its valued assistance in this case.”\n“The darknet has been a key online marketplace for the sale of deadly drugs worldwide,” said Administrator Anne Milgram of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). “The availability of illicit substances and money laundering services offered by Hydra threaten the safety and health of communities far and wide. Criminals on the darknet hide behind the illusion of anonymity, but DEA and our partners across the globe are watching. We will continue to investigate, expose, and take action against criminal networks no matter where they operate. I commend the extraordinary investigative efforts of DEA’s Miami Counternarcotic Cyber Investigations Task Force, Cyber Support Section, and Special Operations Division, and the teamwork from federal and international law enforcement partners that led to this action.”\n“The Hydra darknet site provided a platform for criminals who thought they were beyond the reaches of law enforcement to buy and sell illegal drugs and services,” said Chief Jim Lee of IRS-Criminal Investigation. “Our Cyber Crimes Unit once again used their cryptocurrency tracking expertise to help take down this site and identify the criminal behind it. Denying criminals a space to operate freely to conduct their nefarious activities is the first step in stopping this activity from happening altogether.”\n“The successful seizure of Hydra, the world's largest darknet marketplace, dismantled digital infrastructures which had enabled a wide range of criminals – including Russian cyber criminals, the cryptocurrency tumblers and money launderers that support them and others, and drug traffickers,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “Today’s announcement is a testament to the strength and potency of our law enforcement partnerships here and around the world – and another example of our strategy to broadly target the entire illicit ecosystem that drives and enables crime.”\n“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is dedicated to protecting the United States mail from being used to transport illegal drugs and illicit goods available on the darknet,” said Chief Postal Inspector Gary R. Barksdale of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service National Headquarters. “The seizure of the criminal marketplace, Hydra Market, reflects the effective collaboration of law enforcement to stop criminal enterprises from their illicit activity. The Postal Inspection Service will continue to work with our federal partners to end these criminal organizations regardless of where they are.”\n“The dismantling of the Hydra Market, the dark web’s largest supplier of illicit goods and services, sends a message to these electronic criminal kingpins that think they can operate with impunity,” said Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami. “HSI will continue to work with our U.S. and international law enforcement partners to target these transnational criminal organizations who attempt to manipulate the anonymity of the dark web to push their poison all over the world.”\nAccording to the indictment, vendors on Hydra could create accounts on the site to advertise their illegal products, and buyers could create accounts to view and purchase the vendors’ products. Hydra vendors offered a variety of illicit drugs for sale, including cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD, heroin and other opioids. The vendors openly advertised their drugs on Hydra, typically including photographs and a description of the controlled substance. Buyers rated the sellers and their products on a five-star rating system, and the vendors’ ratings and reviews were prominently displayed on the Hydra site.\nHydra also featured numerous vendors selling false identification documents. Users could search for vendors selling their desired type of identification document – for example, U.S. passports or drivers’ licenses – and filter or sort by the item’s price. Many vendors of false identification documents offered to customize the documents based on photographs or other information provided by the buyers.\nNumerous vendors also sold hacking tools and hacking services through Hydra. Hacking vendors commonly offered to illegally access online accounts of the buyer’s choosing. In this way, buyers could select their victims and hire professional hackers to gain access to the victims’ communications and take over the victims’ accounts.\nHydra vendors also offered a robust array of money laundering and so-called “cash-out” services, which allowed Hydra users to convert their bitcoin (BTC) into a variety of forms of currency supported by Hydra’s wide array of vendors. In addition, Hydra offered an in-house mixing service to launder and then process vendors’ withdrawals. Mixing services allowed customers, for a fee, to send bitcoin to designated recipients in a manner that was designed to conceal the source or owner of the bitcoin. Hydra’s money laundering features were so in-demand that some users would set up shell vendor accounts for the express purpose of running money through Hydra’s bitcoin wallets as a laundering technique.\nStarting in or about November 2015, Pavlov is alleged to have operated a company, Promservice Ltd., also known as Hosting Company Full Drive, All Wheel Drive and 4x4host.ru, that administered Hydra’s servers (Promservice). During that time, Pavlov, through his company Promservice, administered Hydra’s servers, which allowed the market to operate as a platform used by thousands of drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute large quantities of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to thousands of buyers, and to launder billions of dollars derived from these unlawful transactions.\nAs an active administrator in hosting Hydra’s servers, Pavlov allegedly conspired with the other operators of Hydra to further the site’s success by providing the critical infrastructure that allowed Hydra to operate and thrive in a competitive darknet market environment. In doing so, Pavlov is alleged to have facilitated Hydra’s activities and allowed Hydra to reap commissions worth millions of dollars generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site.\nThe DEA’s Miami Field Division, FBI, IRS-CI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and HSI investigated the case.\nThe U.S. investigation was conducted with support and coordination provided by the Department of Justice’s multi-agency Special Operations Division and the Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) Team.\nTrial Attorneys C. Alden Pelker and Christen M. Gallagher of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Claudia A. Quiroz and Robert S. Leach for the Northern District of California are prosecuting the case.\nIn addition to the critically important efforts of the German Federal Criminal Police, significant assistance was provided by the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. Assistance was also provided by the Justice Department’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team.\nAn indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\nUpdated April 5, 2022\nAttachment\nPavlov Indictment\n[PDF,\n]\nTopic\nCybercrime\nComponents\nCriminal Division\nCriminal - Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nUSAO - California, Northern\nPress Release Number:\n22-327\nRelated Content\nPress Release\nOperators of Cryptocurrency Mixers Charged with Money Laundering\nA federal grand jury in the Northern District of Georgia returned an indictment on Jan. 7 charging three Russian nationals for their involvement in operating the cryptocurrency mixing services Blender.io...\nJanuary 10, 2025\nPress Release\nTwo California Men Charged in Largest NFT Scheme Prosecuted to Date\nA six-count indictment was unsealed today in Los Angeles charging two California men with defrauding investors of more than $22 million in cryptocurrency through a series of digital asset project...\nDecember 20, 2024\nPress Release\nUnited States Charges Dual Russian and Israeli National as Developer of LockBit Ransomware Group\nA superseding criminal complaint filed in the District of New Jersey was unsealed today charging a dual Russian and Israeli national for being a developer of the LockBit ransomware group.\nDecember 20, 2024\nOffice of Public Affairs\nU.S. Department of Justice\n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW\nWashington DC 20530\nOffice of Public Affairs Direct Line\n202-514-2007\nDepartment of Justice Main Switchboard\n202-514-2000\nSignup for Email Updates\nSocial Media\ntwitter\nfacebook\nyoutube\ninstagram\nlinkedin\nAbout\nArchives\nFOIA\nAccessibility\nLegal Policies & Disclaimers\nPrivacy\nFor Employees\nOffice of the Inspector General\nNo FEAR Act Data\nVulnerability Disclosure\nEspañol\nVote.gov\nHave a question about Government Services?\nContact USA.gov\nTop"

This was actually brought up just a little while ago,\nin this post\n.\nAnd answered best in the answer there by another community member,\nPossible vulnerability in checking saved password in database\nFor those not reading the resources linked above, the passwords being checked are never sent in clear-text. In the unlikely event that someone intercepts the network traffic using a SSL decrypter while you are running a report, all they would get is the first 5 characters of a SHA-1 hash of the passwords being checked, a so-called hashprefix.\nBottom line:\nIf your passwords have not been previously been leaked (“pwned”), it would be impossible to deduce the password from the hashprefix information.\nIf you have a password that\nhas\nbeen pwned, then someone who has the hashprefix and who also has a hash table of\nall\nleaked passwords could narrow down your password to a subset of around 400-600 entries in that table. Is this a security vulnerability? I would argue that it is not really, because your password is already on the list of leaked passwords (available for anybody to see). With modern hardware, it really isn’t\nthat\nmuch harder to brute force the entire list of leaked passwords (a few billion) vs. just brute-forcing a shortlist of 400 candidates. As long as you\nimmediately\nchange any password that is identified as having been leaked, you should be safe.\nHope that answers your question, as it stands Bitwarden is able to check against known leaked password databases and still retain a zero-knowledge architecture where only you ever have control of your stored information.\ngrb\nOctober 27, 2022, 12:19am\n3\nTo add some further clarification, when you run an\nExposed Passwords Report\nfrom your Web Vault, it is\nnot\nBitwarden (the company) that is looking up your passwords on the dark web.  It is the Bitwarden code running on\nyour own\ncomputer that is accessing the decrypted passwords kept in the memory of\nyour\ncomputer; the same Bitwarden code (running only on\nyour\ncomputer) computes the hashes, and sends the hashprefix values to the\nhaveibeenpwned\nservice.  Thus, Bitwarden (the company) is able to identify exposed passwords without ever having access to any of you password.\ntoropih\n(toropih)\nOctober 27, 2022, 11:26am\n4\nThank you guys for the clarification, understood.\nFollowing the links above I also found this more detailed explanation:\nTroy Hunt – 21 Feb 18\nI've Just Launched \"Pwned Passwords\" V2 With Half a Billion Passwords for...\nLast August, I launched a little feature within Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) I called Pwned Passwords. This was a list of 320 million passwords from a range of different data breaches which organisations could use to better protect their own systems....\nHome\nCategories\nGuidelines\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nPowered by\nDiscourse\n, best viewed with JavaScript enabled"

The operation targeting Hydra was a collaborative initiative joined by the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigations, Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and Homeland Security Investigations. This action was enhanced by international cooperation with the German Federal Criminal Police, who today shut down Hydra servers in Germany and seized $25 million worth of bitcoin.\n“The global threat of cybercrime and ransomware that originates in Russia, and the ability of criminal leaders to operate there with impunity, is deeply concerning to the United States,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Our actions send a message today to criminals that you cannot hide on the darknet or their forums, and you cannot hide in Russia or anywhere else in the world. In coordination with allies and partners, like Germany and Estonia, we will continue to disrupt these networks.”\nDarknets are Internet-based networks that individuals use special software to access in a manner designed to obscure the individuals’ identity and their associated Internet activity. Marketplaces that reside on the darknet almost exclusively accept virtual currency as payment for a large range of illegal services and goods, including ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). Virtual currency is often the payment method of choice on darknet marketplaces because illicit actors who transact on the darknet often incorrectly believe virtual currencies to be an anonymous and untraceable means of exchange. Ransomware payments are also often demanded in virtual currency for similar reasons. Countering ransomware is a top priority of the Administration. Today’s action supports the Administration’s counter-ransomware lines of effort to disrupt ransomware infrastructure and actors in close coordination with international partners. The U.S. and German government’s action today addresses the abuse of virtual currency to launder ransom payments.\nRussia is a haven for cybercriminals. Today’s action against Hydra and Garantex builds upon recent sanctions against virtual currency exchanges SUEX and CHATEX, both of which, like Garantex, operated out of Federation Tower in Moscow, Russia. Treasury is committed to taking action against actors that, like Hydra and Garantex, willfully disregard anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations and allow their systems to be abused by illicit actors. Wanton disregard for regulations and compliance by persons that run virtual currency exchanges will be rigorously investigated, and where appropriate, perpetrators will be held accountable. Additionally, the United States urges the international community to effectively implement international standards on AML/CFT in the virtual currency area, particularly regarding virtual currency exchanges. The virtual currency industry has a critical role to play in implementing appropriate AML/CFT and sanctions controls to prevent sanctioned persons and other illicit actors from exploiting virtual currencies to undermine the national security of the United States and our partners.\nIn addition to sanctioning Hydra, OFAC is identifying over\n100 virtual currency addresses\nassociated with the entity’s operations that have been used to conduct illicit transactions. Treasury is committed to sharing additional illicit virtual currency addresses as they become available.\nAs reflected in Executive Order (E.O.) 14067 of March 9, 2022, “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets,” the Administration supports responsible innovation in digital assets, while prioritizing efforts to identify and mitigate illicit financing risks in the digital asset ecosystem. In the coming month, the Department of the Treasury will publish an updated National Strategy to Combat Illicit Finance, which will highlight planned Treasury efforts to further combat the misuse of virtual currency and exchanges.\nHYDRA MARKET: RUSSIA’S MOST PROMINENT DARKNET MARKET\nHydra\nwas launched in 2015 and is the most prominent Russian darknet market, and the largest darknet market left in the world. Hydra’s offerings have included ransomware-as-a-service, hacking services and software, stolen personal information, counterfeit currency, stolen virtual currency, and illicit drugs. Following a sale, Hydra’s vendors have distributed illicit goods dropped anonymously in physical locations, sometimes buried or hidden in an inconspicuous location. Hydra’s buyers received the location after purchase, often using virtual currency, and retrieved the illicit goods.\nOFAC’s investigation identified approximately $8 million in ransomware proceeds that transited Hydra’s virtual currency accounts, including from the Ryuk, Sodinokibi, and Conti ransomware variants. According to blockchain researchers, approximately 86 percent of the illicit Bitcoin received directly by Russian virtual currency exchanges in 2019 came from Hydra. Before today’s action, Hydra’s revenue had risen dramatically from under $10 million in 2016, to over $1.3 billion in 2020. This growth in profit is enabled by Hydra’s association with Russian illicit finance. Additional details on the illicit financing risks associated with darknet markets can be found in the\nNational Money Laundering Risk Assessment\n.\nHydra is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, for being responsible for or complicit in, or having engaged in, directly or indirectly, cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States that are reasonably likely to result in, or have materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States and that have the purpose or effect of causing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources, trade secrets, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain.\nVIRTUAL CURRENCY EXCHANGE GARANTEX\nGarantex\nis a virtual currency exchange founded in late 2019 and originally registered in Estonia. Garantex allows customers to buy and sell virtual currencies using fiat currencies. The majority of Garantex’s operations are carried out in Moscow, including at Federation Tower, and St. Petersburg, Russia, where other sanctioned virtual currency exchanges have also operated. Analysis of known Garantex transactions shows that over $100 million in transactions are associated with illicit actors and darknet markets, including nearly $6 million from Russian RaaS gang Conti and also including approximately $2.6 million from Hydra. In February 2022, Garantex lost its license to provide virtual currency services after supervision by Estonia’s Financial Intelligence Unit revealed critical AML/CFT deficiencies and found connections between Garantex and wallets used for criminal activity. Estonian authorities coordinated closely with the Treasury Department during this process. This is the\nsecond time\nin the last six months that Treasury has partnered with the Estonian government in relation to a virtual currency exchange facilitating malicious cyber activity. Despite losing its Estonian license to provide virtual currency services following the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit’s investigation, Garantex continues to provide services to customers through unscrupulous means.\nGarantex is being designated today pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy.\nToday’s action also reinforces OFAC’s recent\npublic guidance\nto further cut off avenues for potential sanctions evasion by Russia, in support of the G7 leaders’ commitment to maintain the effectiveness of economic measures. This guidance in the form of\nFrequently Asked Question 1,021\nmakes clear that Treasury’s expansive sanctions actions against Russia require all U.S. persons to comply with OFAC regulations, regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency. Sanctioned Russian persons are known to employ a wide variety of measures in their efforts to evade U.S. and international sanctions. As such, U.S. persons, wherever located, including firms that process virtual currency transactions, must be vigilant against attempts to circumvent OFAC regulations and must take risk-based steps to ensure they do not engage in prohibited transactions. OFAC is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance.\nWhile most virtual currency activity is licit, virtual currencies can be used for illicit activity, including sanctions evasion through darknet markets, peer-to-peer exchangers, mixers, and exchanges. This includes the facilitation of ransomware schemes and other cybercrimes. Some virtual currency exchanges are exploited by malicious actors, but others, as is the case with Garantex, Suex, and Chatex, facilitate illicit activities for their own gains. Treasury continues to use its authorities against malicious cyber actors and their facilitators in concert with other U.S. departments and agencies, as well as our foreign partners, to disrupt financial nodes tied to ransomware payments, cyber-attacks, and other illicit activity.\nSANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS\nAs a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the individuals and entities described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt. These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\nFor identifying information on the individuals, entities, and property sanctioned or identified today, click here.\nFor information on complying with sanctions applicable to virtual currency, see\nOFAC’s Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry here\n.\nFor FinCEN’s recent alert identifying red flags on potential Russian sanctions evasion attempts, including through the use of cryptocurrency, see here\n.\n###\nUse featured image\nOff\nLatest News\nJanuary 17, 2025\nSecretary of the Treasury Janet L.

Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Nicola T. Hanna for the Central District of California, U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott for the Eastern District of California, Assistant Director in Charge Paul Delacourt of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Chris Nielsen of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) San Francisco Division, Chief Don Fort of IRS Criminal Investigation, Inspector in Charge Michael Ray of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Acting Executive Associate Director Alysa D. Erichs of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) made the announcement.\nA criminal complaint filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges that the three defendants, who currently are in custody in Germany, were the administrators of WSM, a sophisticated online marketplace available in six languages that allowed approximately 5,400 vendors to sell illegal goods to about 1.15 million customers around the world.  Like other dark web marketplaces previously shut down by authorities –\nSilk Road\nand\nAlphaBay\n, for example – WSM functioned like a conventional e-commerce website, but it was a hidden service located beyond the reach of traditional internet browsers on the Tor network, a service designed to conceal user identities.\nFor nearly three years, WSM allegedly was operated on the dark web by the three men who now face charges in both the United States and Germany.  An “exit scam” was allegedly conducted last month when the WSM administrators took all of the virtual currency held in marketplace escrow and user accounts – believed by investigators to be approximately $11 million – and then diverted the money to their own accounts.  Exit scams are common among large darknet marketplaces, which typically hold money in escrow while a vendor delivers illicit goods.\nThe three defendants charged in the United States were arrested in Germany on April 23 and 24.  They are:\nA 23-year-old resident of Kleve, Germany;\nA 31-year-old resident of Wurzburg, Germany; and\nA 29-year-old resident of Stuttgart, Germany.\nThese defendants also face charges in Germany. See:\nhttps://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/double-blow-to-dark-web-marketplaces\nand\nhttps://twitter.com/bka\n.\nA fourth defendant linked to Wall Street Market was charged yesterday in a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento, California.  Marcos Paulo De Oliveira-Annibale, 29, of Sao Paulo, Brazil, also faces federal drug distribution and money laundering charges for allegedly acting as a moderator who, among other things, mediated disputes between vendors and their customers.  Annibale, who used the online monikers “MED3LIN,” also acted as a public relations representative for WSM by, among others things, promoting WSM on websites such as Reddit, according to the complaint.  The case naming Annibale was unsealed today when Brazilian authorities executed a search warrant at his residence.\n“Just as international law-enforcement partners began dismantling Wall Street Market and taking action against its members, as alleged in the complaint, the site’s administrators decided to steal their customers’ money via an exit scam,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski.  “This operation sends a crystal-clear message: dark markets offer no safe haven.  The arrest and prosecution of the criminals who allegedly ran this darknet marketplace is a great example of our partnership with law enforcement authorities in Europe, with the support of Europol, and demonstrates what we can do when we stand together.”\n“We continue to keep pace with sophisticated actors on the dark web by increasing our technical abilities and working even more closely with our international law enforcement partners,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna. “While they lurk in the deepest corners of the internet, this case shows that we can hunt down these criminals wherever they hide.”\n“We are on the hunt for even the tiniest of breadcrumbs to identify criminals on the dark web,” said U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott.  “The prosecution of these defendants shows that even the smallest mistake will allow us to figure out a cybercriminal’s true identity.  As with defendant Marcos Annibale, forum posts and pictures of him online from years ago allowed us to connect the dots between him and his online persona ‘Med3l1n.’  No matter where they live, we will investigate and prosecute criminals who create, maintain, and promote dark web marketplaces to sell illegal drugs and other contraband.”\nThe affidavit in support of the criminal complaint filed in Los Angeles outlines how the defendants operated a sophisticated online marketplace that offered encrypted communications between buyers and sellers, as well as an online forum to discuss vendors and the quality of their wares.  The affidavit also describes an international investigation that was able to identify the three administrators of WSM, show how they previously operated another German-based darknet marketplace that shut down in 2016, and link them to computer servers in Germany and the Netherlands that were used to operate WSM and process virtual currency transactions.\nThe three defendants allegedly created WSM, maintained the website, and operated the marketplace to ensure that buyers could access vendor pages and that financial transactions were properly processed.  The investigation outlined in the complaint affidavit linked the three defendants to WSM in a number of ways, including their access to the WSM computer infrastructure.  One defendant, for example, used virtual private networks to access WSM computers, but when a VPN connection would fail, his IP was revealed and authorities were able to identify his specific location.\nThe three defendants charged in the Central District of California were arrested in Germany after the WSM administrators conducted an exit scam in the wake of WSM recently becoming regarded as the world’s pre-eminent dark web marketplace and gaining a significant influx of new vendors and users, according to the affidavit.  On April 16, vendors realized they could not collect the virtual funds that had been placed in escrow by their customers, which prompted German authorities to execute a series of arrest and search warrants.\nThe complaint affidavit identifies several cases that have been filed in the United States against WSM vendors.\nOne darknet vendor\nwho advertised on WSM is currently serving a 12-year federal prison sentence after being convicted in the Western District of Wisconsin for distributing a fentanyl analogue resulting in the overdose death of a Florida resident who ordered a nasal spray laced with the powerful opioid from the vendor.\nTwo of the “top vendors” on WSM – identified by the online monikers Platinum45 and Ladyskywalker – were based in the Los Angeles area and were major drug distributors.  One vender, “Ladyskywalker,” operated on several darknet marketplaces, where the individual advertised and sold opioids such as fentanyl, oxycodone and hydrocodone.\nThe second top vendor – who used the moniker “Platinum45” and operated on at least two darknet marketplaces, including WSM – advertised and sold drugs such as methamphetamine, Adderall and oxycodone to customers in the United States and around the world, including in Germany and Australia.  “Platinum45” also manufactured Adderall tablets and advertised the sale of up to 1 kilogram quantities of methamphetamine on WSM.\n“Investigators from many countries overcame the national, legal and diplomatic challenges to hold accountable sophisticated actors who operated one of the largest known encrypted marketplaces in the shadowy environment of the Darknet,” said Assistant Director Paul Delacourt of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office.  “This case is an example of successful global collaboration among law enforcement entities who share the many challenges of prosecuting transnational criminal activity conducted by individuals who operate anonymously across borders.”\n“The dark web marketplace, Wall Street Market, was one of the largest operating hosts for vendors peddling illegal wares,” said DEA San Francisco Special Agent in Charge Chris Nielsen.  “Law enforcement is always adapting to changes in technology and this case sends a clear message to those breaking the law and attempting to hide behind the illusion of anonymity – we will identify and find you.  The success of this case is due to the excellent cooperation between law enforcement agencies from around the globe who delivered another blow to criminal networks operating in the underground cyberspace.”\n“Anyone who thinks the dark web is a safe place to conduct illegal commerce should know they are not anonymous,” said Inspector in Charge Michael Ray.  “They will be found and they will be brought to justice.  The Postal Inspection Service has a highly trained, skilled and committed cyber unit that works tirelessly with other law enforcement agencies to disrupt marketplaces and stop vendors from using the U.S. mail to ship illegal goods and dangerous drugs.”\n“Taking down this site is a huge win for past and future victims of crimes perpetrated due to the proliferation of illegal products and services being sold,” said Chief Don Fort of IRS Criminal Investigation.  “We are committed to using our unique financial investigative abilities to tackle these kinds of threats head on to protect citizens, to promote cyber security and to inform the global community.”\n“HSI and our partners are at the forefront of combating narcotics trafficking, financial

Erichs. “While criminal operators may continue to grow the reach of their businesses through these dark web marketplaces, ultimately they do not escape the reach of law enforcement.

This information is critical to preventing fraud, combatting account takeovers, and stopping high-risk attacks tied to malware.\nThis update comes as new SpyCloud research finds millions of dark web exposures over the past 12 months for the customers of the top 50 banks operating in the United States. Those key findings include:\nOver 5.9 million breach and malware exposures, which have been detected across 2,755 data sources\nOver 5.8 million stolen passwords belonging to bank customers\nNearly 81,000 consumers using malware-infected devices to access bank accounts â each having on average 10-12 exposed data assets tied to their identity\nOver 12.9 million pieces of stolen personally identifiable information (PII), data that enables new account creation, synthetic identities, and other forms of identity fraud\nAn average password reuse rate of 83%, which is 13 points higher than employees of the same organizations (70%)\n“When consumers become victims of malware infections, criminals siphon their login credentials, session cookies, and more that can allow them to impersonate that user across other accounts and systems mostly undetected. SpyCloudâs rich recaptured data analysis highlights a variety of information about exposed consumers logging into financial institution domains that they wouldnât otherwise have access to. On our website, we provide a free exposure summary and can then explore the data at a deeper level, sharing how hundreds of global businesses use SpyCloud to better prevent fraudulent transactions, account takeover, and other cyberattacks that have financial consequences to the business.”\n–\nDamon Fleury\n, SpyCloudâs Chief Product Officer\nSpyCloudâs Check Your Exposure tool is used by thousands of business users and individuals per month. It draws on over 680+ billion recaptured darknet data assets to power its analytics. By inputting a business email, users will receive insight into high-risk malware and breach exposures tied to their business domain from the last 12 months.\nSpyCloud counts among its customers two of the top five U.S. banks and the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, along with dozens of retail and investment banks, card networks, and payment processors. Earlier this year, SpyCloud released the following solutions for\nfinancial institutions\n:\nSpyCloudâs Compromised Credit Card API allows financial institutions and companies who issue credit cards, gift cards, and loyalty cards to automatically monitor and detect exposed card numbers.\nConsumer ATO Prevention Zero-Knowledge API allows security and fraud teams to query user credentials for exposure while meeting compliance and regulatory requirements.\nBusinesses can access the free Check Your Exposure tool to check Consumersâ Risk\nhere\nand take the first step in protecting their organization from malware-infected users.\nAbout SpyCloud\nSpyCloud transforms recaptured darknet data to protect businesses from cyberattacks. Its products operationalize Cybercrime Analytics (C2A) to produce actionable insights that allow enterprises to proactively prevent ransomware and account takeover, safeguard employee and consumer identities, and investigate cybercrime incidents.

Burchard made his initial appearance in federal court Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Erica P. Grosjean in Fresno.\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Burchard, using the moniker “Caliconnect,” was a major narcotics vendor on the Silk Road and other Darknet marketplaces, such as Agora, Abraxas, and AlphaBay. Darknet marketplaces operate on computer networks designed to conceal the true Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computers accessing them. In addition, Darknet marketplaces only allow payments to be made in the form of digital currency, most commonly in Bitcoin. While not inherently illegal, digital currency is used by Darknet marketplaces because online transactions in digital currency can be completed without a third-party payment processor and are therefore perceived to be more anonymous and less vulnerable to law enforcement scrutiny.\n“The Department of Justice and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to investigate and prosecute major interstate narcotics traffickers,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner. “Those traffickers who believe they can escape the scrutiny of law enforcement by conducting their business on the dark web and receiving payments in digital currency are mistaken.”\nAccording to the complaint, Burchard accepted orders for marijuana and cocaine on Darknet marketplaces and then mailed the narcotics from post offices in Merced and Fresno counties to customers throughout the U.S. Burchard was paid primarily in Bitcoin. The federal government estimates Burchard, whose sales through the Silk Road exceeded $1.4 million before that website was closed, was one of the largest vendors on that site. The complaint alleges that after federal law enforcement shut down the Silk Road website and arrested its founder in October 2013, Burchard transferred his narcotics business to Agora, and then to AlphaBay.\n“HSI and our partners are at the forefront of combating illicit activities and financial crimes now seen in virtual currency systems,” said Ryan L. Spradlin, special agent in charge of HSI San Francisco. “Criminals continue to spread their businesses through online black markets using digital currency like Bitcoin, however they do not escape the reach of law enforcement. We continue to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle hidden illegal networks that pose a threat in cyberspace.”\n“The combined efforts of law enforcement agencies in this type of investigation produce a formidable force against narcotics trafficking,” said Michael T. Batdorf, special agent in charge of IRS-Criminal Investigation. “With the increase use of the dark web to facilitate the drug trade and other illicit activities, IRS-CI will continue to trace the complex financial transactions that identify where the money comes from and where it goes.”\n“Postal Inspectors worked closely with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our partners in law enforcement on this investigation and will continue to vigorously protect the U.S. Mail against all forms of criminal misuse,” said Rafael Nunez, inspector in charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s San Francisco Division.\nTrial Attorney Anitha Ibrahim with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section aided with the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Grant Rabenn is prosecuting the case.\nUpdated:\n11/18/2024\nReturn to top\nMedia Inquiries\nFor media inquiries about ICE activities, operations, or policies, contact the ICE Office of Public Affairs at\nICEMedia@ice.dhs.gov\n.\nAbout Us\nImmigration Enforcement\nCombating Transnational Crime\nNewsroom\nICE Contact Center\nReport suspicious activity:\n1-866-DHS-2-ICE\nICE.gov\nAn official website of the\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\nICE USWDS Footer Links\nAbout ICE\nAccessibility\nFOIA Requests\nPrivacy Policy\nDHS.gov\nArchive\nNo FEAR Act Data\nSite Links\nPerformance Reports\nInspector General\nThe White House\nDHS Components\nUSA.gov\nMobile Menu Bar\nMenu\nSearch\nEn Español\nContact\nMain Navigation on Mobile Devices\nAbout Us\nMission\nWho We Are\nLeadership\nHistory\nInformation Library\nCareer Opportunities\nImmigration Enforcement\nIdentify and Arrest\nCriminal Apprehension Program\nFugitive Operations\nImmigration Authority Delegation Program 287(g)\nImmigration Detainers\nDetain\nDetention Facilities\nHealth Service Corps\nDetention Management\nFacility Inspections\nFamily Residential Standards\nRemove\nRecalcitrant Countries\nRemoval\nERO Statistics Dashboard\nCombating Transnational Crime\nOperational Priorities\nProtecting National Security\nPreventing Crimes of Exploitation\nSecuring the Border\nEnsuring Public Safety\nUpholding Fairness in Global Trade\nInvestigating Cybercrime\nCombating Financial Crime\nInvestigations\nOutreach Programs\nPartnerships & Centers\nRecognize & Report Crime\nNewsroom\nNews Releases and Statements\nFeature Stories\nMultimedia\nSocial Media\nSpeeches and Testimonies\nSearch\nSearch\nHome\nWho We Are\nNewsroom\nInformation Library\nContact ICE\nCareers\nEn Español"

The effect of the exchanges provides less skilled threat actors with better developed malware without having to acquire firsthand knowledge. Exchanges also facilitate the sale of advanced malware on Darknet markets, though this type of malware continues to be gated and limited to vetted participants, creating significant roadblocks to newcomers. The exchange of knowledge and software commodities under a high degree of anonymity increases the speed of malware deployment and access to more advanced payloads for cyberattacks. Despite increased TTPs available and low barrier to entry for new users, openly advertised malware offerings remain limited to commodity malware.\nBackground\nEclecticIQ’s threat research team performed a survey of popular darknet sites to evaluate the sophistication of malware and tools currently organized in the open. Observing the state of promotion and ease of access to malware on common forums and marketplaces provide qualitative data on how malware and threat actors are evolving. For this investigation, EclecticIQ explored the following popular darknet sites: Raid Forum, Exploit.in, White House Market, Dread Forum, and Vice City Market\n(1)\n.\nThe Darknet—Cybercrime Nexus\nThe darknet (darkweb) is a segregated, non-indexed volume of the internet that relies on the TOR and other protocols to provide request origin anonymity and display requested content to end users\n(2)\n. The TorBrowser is an open-source application that provides access to darknet sites, but many other applications are available. Many darknet marketplaces and forums offer free access without collecting personal details, making them popular with users throughout the globe who rely on anonymity for a variety of reasons\n(3)\n. Like the clear web, the darknet includes forums where users self-organize to exchange goods or ideas with little oversight.\nCybercriminals possess a broad array of capability across the cyber threat spectrum. Threat actors operate a large volume and variety of malware that includes “commodity malware.” Commodity malware (Malware-as-a-Service (Maas), Crimeware-as-a-Service (CaaS), and off-the-shelf malware) includes malware capabilities developed by cybercriminals for cybercriminals and exchanged most commonly via the darknet. This form of malware typically represents the greatest share of malware used in attacks since it is bought and sold in volume.\nAnalysis\nThe Dynamics of Darknet Marketplaces Incentivize Novice Users to Malware Development and Cyberattacks\nForums on the darknet discussing and exchanging malware serve as easy access points for users of all skill levels. A person with minimal computer knowledge can access a large selection of Darknet forums and marketplaces where cyber tools and malware are openly exchanged. A user can easily acquire free accounts with just an email address, username, and password. A variety of malware is available to most new users regardless of skill level. Users with less computer knowledge can piggy-back on the knowledge of much more skilled developers, exchange ideas, and build more sophisticated attacks with less time, effort, and detail. Transactions use cryptocurrency providing a further layer of anonymity. The anonymity and ease of access on the Darknet make it an extremely fluid marketplace, with new buyers and sellers constantly coming and going. According to the Tor Project, the number of unique .onion addresses significantly spiked around the time many countries went into initial Covid-19 lockdowns in the first quarter of 2020\n(4)\n.\nFeatures Included in Malware Packages Allow Less Skilled Users to Operate Malware\nIn general, malware-as-a-service (MaaS) families offered on darknet marketplaces are not overly sophisticated, so potential buyers with only a basic understanding of computer systems or coding knowledge can successfully acquire malware needed to execute an attack. Most malware listings across forums tend to be similar – like items sold in a tourist market. Developers advertise malware with very common built-in features that include taking screenshots, stealing passwords, logging keystrokes, and intercepting other data on a targeted machine.\nTypical commodity malware (MaaS) listing of typical TTPs.\nMany malwares come with built-out features that make operation easier for less experienced users. Packages can include elaborate point-and-click portal interfaces (command and control panels) for directing malware as well as robust support channels for troubleshooting. The many features take operation away from command lines and terminals, making the operation easier for novice users to navigate. All these factors lower the barrier to entry for malware attacks.\nAlthough many malware families exist, they are largely of similar caliber.\nThis screenshot depicts a common style Remote Access Trojan for sale.\nMalware family types most commonly advertised on Darknet forums include bots, trojans, remote access trojans, phishing tools, and ransomware. EclecticIQ analysts observed a notable portion of posts advertising Cobalt Strike, which aligns with recent reporting detailing Cobalt Strike’s popularity among cyber threat actors\n(5)\n.\nA malware listing that comes with a client portal yielding an easy-to-use graphical user interface.\nUsers Have Access to More Complete Kill Chains\nDifferent groups of vendors on the same darknet site specialize in different skills and types of listings. They offer a selection of malware, compromised network access, and further tooling, giving users access to more complete malware Kill-Chains. Once engaged on a particular site users can acquire malware, credentials or network access to victims, and tools to successfully infect networks and endpoints. This organization of skill-backgrounds provides aspiring cybercriminals with an easier plug-and-play approach to launch attacks and change TTPs. Users do not have to personally acquire background knowledge in code or computer science that would otherwise be requisite to operate malware.\nAdvanced MaaS is Not Observed Openly\nMaaS listings of higher sophistication with more built-in capabilities are available, but vendors offering improved capabilities guard the listings from brand new users and novices. For certain listings, potential buyers are required to validate themselves through forum reputation scores.\nA listing where the seller takes extra care to validate certain potential clients.\nThe requirements presents a clear barrier to the novice. Another barrier to obtaining more sophisticated malware is minimum forum-based reputation scores. Reputation score is acquired in the form of feedback from other users who have claimed to interact with one another. Feedback authenticity is nearly impossible to verify for observers. There is strong evidence that sellers can carry over reputations from other forums, allowing them to build cumulative years of experience and maintain in large groups despite the temporal nature of darknet markets\n(6)\n.\nExperienced Users Almost Certainly Exchange More Advanced Malware Outside Public Channels\nAdvanced developers are present on all forums to facilitate initial contact but may not conduct business on the forum itself. These vendors provide a simplified and somewhat non-descript initial post or listing on a forum regarding a particular malware and then immediately divert further conversation to a private channel such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and other encrypted chat or email applications.\nA listing with more vague and terse language. The developers are likely more advanced in terms of knowledge and capability than those behind other similar listings.\nThe behavior provides improved operational security while communicating with individuals outside of more exclusive circles. This and other measures such as the use of indirect language, allow malware developers and buyers to continue operating while evading law enforcement operations, which historically are drawn to highly publicized malware and attacks\n(7)\n.\nOutlook\nListings in Common Malware Markets Remain Consistent, But with Limited Capability\nEclecticIQ analysts have not observed particularly advanced forms of malware openly broadcast, but Darknet forums provide an abundance of malware options for users at any skill level. The sophistication and variety of commodity malware in popular darknet markets remains relatively flat and the risk from high-volume malware (Commodity malware and MaaS) remains unchanged compared to recent years. Advancements in malware on the darknet are expected to continue at a steady pace as general knowledge, participation, and technology advancement equip more users with access to a plug-and-play approach to malware TTPs, which contribute to a more complete kill-chain and make it easier to launch cyberattacks.\nIncreased Government Regulation Will be The Greatest Factor in Curbing Commodity Malware Growth\nGovernment policy to cybercriminal justice stands to be the single greatest influencer of the growth of Darknet markets. Prioritization of cybercriminal law enforcement could potentially limit open interactions on the Darknet by making cybercriminal activity more vulnerable to law enforcement action. This could reduce the amount of criminal activity by making cybercrime riskier, or it could drive malicious activities away from open public channels that have a larger audience. Regardless, the recent spate of government attention toward cybercrime will help threat hunters and security experts understand how threat actors use darknet forms as a tool to commit cybercrime.\nAppendix\nhttps://dnstats.net/list-of-darknet-markets/\nhttps://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Verbraucherinnen-und-Verbraucher/Informationen-und-Empfehlungen/Darknet-und-Deep-Web/darknet-und-deep-web_node.html\nhttp://geography.oii.ox.ac.uk/the-anonymous-internet/\nhttps://metrics.torproject.org/hidserv-dir-onions-seen.html?start=2019-04-24&end=2021-07-23\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/cobalt-strike-favorite-tool-apt-crimeware\nhttps://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/dark-web-monitoring-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/\n,\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74416-y\nhttps://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action\n,\nhttps://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/20/trickbot-ransomware-disruption-update/\nAbout EclecticIQ Threat Research\nEclecticIQ is a global provider of threat intelligence, hunting and response technology and services.

I then run the generated onnx using tensorRT. I had no errors during the conversion. All output from the tensorRT inference of yolov4 are as it should be so I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong there.\nI’ve observed that the speed is not as it should be. I’m working under the assumption that the tensorRT engines should run faster than the darknet models.\nHere are some numbers:\nyolov4_416_416: 40ms (using darknet)\nyolov4_416_416: 45ms (using onnx → converted to tensorRT engine)\nThe yolov4 tensorRT engine seems to be running slower than the yolov4 darknet. Any reason why?\nFor comparison, I used a yolov3 onnx (converted using a different script). The tensorRT engine runs faster than the darknet in this case. I use the same inference script as I did for the yolov4.\nYOLOV3\nyolov3_416_416: 38ms (using darknet)\nyolov3_416_416: 30ms (using onnx - converted to tensorRT engine)\n*I used input size of 416 * 416 * 3 and batch size of 4 for my tensorRT results.\nEnvironment\nTensorRT Version\n:  7.0.0.11\nGPU Type\n: GTX 1060\nNvidia Driver Version\n: 26.21.14.4292\nCUDA Version\n: 10.2\nCUDNN Version\n: 7.6.5\nOperating System + Version\n: Windows 10\nPython Version (if applicable)\n: Python 3.6.6\nTensorFlow Version (if applicable)\n: 1.5.0\nPyTorch Version (if applicable)\n: 1.4.0\nBaremetal or Container (if container which image + tag)\n:\n1 Like\nAakankshaS\nAugust 7, 2020,  6:47pm\n2\nHi\n@ColinPs26kt\n,\nCan you please help me with both  the onnx models and scripts.\nMeanwhile you can check for the best practices to improve performance of your engine.\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/archives/tensorrt-700/tensorrt-best-practices/index.html#optimize-performance\nThanks!\nColinPs26kt\nAugust 8, 2020,  9:49am\n3\nHi\n@AakankshaS\n,\nThanks for the link and for following up. I’m familiar with the idea of batching for optimization in TensorRT. I’m using a batch of 4 images from now. I am attaching my script here.\nonnxExpt.cpp\n(11.0 KB)\nThe script is a simplified implementation of what I have so far. I load an image “TestImage.jpg”, do some post processing using opencv functions and copy the image over to the GPU for inference. I’ve removed post-processing steps to keep things simpler. I measure the time elapsed from the time when the enqueue function is called to when the stream is synchronized and the output is copied out to the host.\nI have also attached a model (yolov4_4_3_416_416.onnx). My script converts this onnx model to a .trt file.\nMy question is why the yolov4 tensorRT runs slower than the yolov4 darknet. I saw a similar open issue regarding yolov4 in another discussion thread (\nTensorRT model inference is slower than normal model\n).\nAakankshaS\nAugust 12, 2020,  4:59am\n4\nHi\n@ColinPs26kt\n,\nLooks like you missed to attach your onnx model.\nThanks!\nColinPs26kt\nAugust 12, 2020,  7:35am\n5\nHi\n@AakankshaS\n,\nSorry about that. The file is too large.
