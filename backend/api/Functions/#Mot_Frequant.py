of russias largest hacking forums this article is more than 6 years old dylan curran i spent three weeks studying freehacks one of the dark webs biggest platform for hackers from passports to credit cards nothing is safe tue 24 jul 2018 1100 bst last modified on tue 24 jul 2018 1438 bst share t he darknet or dark web is one of the most fascinating vestiges of humanity weve ever seen its an aggregated swamp of all the darkest aspects of internet activity  child abuse images drug markets gun shops gore smut stolen merchandise anarchist guides terrorist chats identity theft hacking services  im going to focus on the most potent of these tiers  hacking services browsing porn in incognito mode isnt nearly as private as you think  dylan curran read more i spent three weeks studying and translating freehacks one of the largest hacking forums on the internet its a russian community which aims to collectively gather its resources in order to maximize efficiency and knowledge dispersement it works the same as any typical forum you open up tor a specialized browser for browsing the dark web paste in the url and land on a home page with various subforums split into different categories the categories are varied and welldivided hacker world news humor hacking and security carding stealing credit cards and trying to cash them out on the internet botnet a network of bots used to steal data and send spam or perform ddos attacks electronics and phreaking phreaking is trying to break someones security network brutus software used to crack passwords ddos overwhelming a server with requests to shut it down seooptimization programming web development malware and exploits private software clothing market people who use stolen credit cards to buy clothes and resell them financial operations documentation passports driving licenses citizenships blacklist a community judicial system as you can see this forum covers a dizzying amount of illegal activity the entire forum is in russian  and has about 5000 active members this is just the tip of the iceberg too every subforum is split even further into dozens of other subforums to document everything here would take me at least six months and encompass a full book view image in fullscreen a screen grab of the forum photograph  screengrab when you attempt to register on the site youre met with a mission statement of sorts  a weird justification method for their own illegal activities it seems pathological and ironic these hackers who essentially get paid to make life more difficult for people try to justify it with a beguiling proclamation the word hacker is incorrectly used in the meaning of computer burglar by some journalists we hackers refuse to accept such an interpretation of it and continue to imply the meaning of someone who likes to program and enjoy it after reading the above categories do you think these people just enjoy some casual software development once you go through the rigorous registration process where you have to declare why you want to join the forum and what software development skills you have and want to learn you are granted access to this treasure trove of illicit information for this article im going to focus primarily on the hacking and security subforum the very first post i clicked on to is how to get someones physical address not the most comforting topic to start off with but here we are a video is posted detailing a stepbystep process to reversequery addresses and crossreference them against other websites the method uses various sites such as whoiscom and some credit check websites thats as much information as i can give without giving the tutorial myself multiple users have a backandforth with one another discussing the pros and cons of this method as well as how to make it more efficient one user leaves a thorough dissection expanding on the current method it allows the perpetrator to use a phishing website to grab the persons location via the wifi access points around them i cant verify if this method works but the russian users certainly seem to think it does the next thread i ventured into is the grandfathers way of hacking an eccentric title if ive ever seen one perhaps my russianenglish translating software is acting out but ill take what it gives me the user describes how people have a distorted view of hackers how they hack remote computers in basements by simply smashing their keyboard they goes on to describe how the easiest method of penetration occurs through knowing the ip address of the target computer using shared resources you can easily penetrate the fortified walls of a pc the easiest method however is social engineering its fascinating to see how this community works together to take down western systems and divulge chaos and profit from it social engineering in terms of hacking is when you use some clever psychology to make a member of a company trust you and bypass security protocol a common one is to ring the customer support of a company and mask your number to mimic that of an internal phone number you then play the fool and say you cant access a website where you normally could have and that its important to access it for an angry client you then give the customer support agent a link to the website the catch is that you have made a fake website which has a trojan ready to be deposited on to the agents computer the hacker then has access to the companys internal network this thread gives great detail in how to carry this out going into a tutorial of how to mask your phone number using ip range scanners which trojan viruses to use what can be gained once you access the computer and how to get in download everything and get out as quickly as possible its incredibly comprehensive and the other russian users thank him kindly and comment about how concise and informative this chaoswreaking method is in 2016 a turkish citizen hacked the turkish governments id system and downloaded the national id name address date of birth and mother and fathers name of 496 million citizens it was one of the biggest hard leaks we have ever seen a member of this forum took credit for it and posted links to the download of the turkish citizens information i have no doubt its true judging from the users post history are your phone camera and microphone spying on you  dylan curran read more its fascinating to see how this community works together to take down western systems and derive chaos and profit from it typically hackers in firstworld countries are terrified to work together due to the multiplicative risk of a group being caught in russia however the authorities dont seem to care that these hackers are wreaking havoc on the west they are left to their own devices and most users on this forum have been regular members for over six years a lot of the information on this forum is incredibly worrying even if a lot of it is harmless 15yearolds trying to be edgy and hack their friends phones in any case its important to know these communities exist the dark underbelly of the internet isnt going anywhere explore more on
